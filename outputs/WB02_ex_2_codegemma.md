```python
def oet(tna, m):
    """
    Calculates the Annual Effective Interest Rate (AER) from the Annual Nominal Rate (ANN) and the number of compounding periods.

    Args:
        tna: The Annual Nominal Rate (ANN).
        m: The number of compounding periods per year.

    Returns:
        The Annual Effective Interest Rate (AER).
    """
    return (1 + tna / m) ** m - 1
```

**Example Usage:**

```python
print(oet(0.06, 12))  # Monthly compounding
print(oet(0.07, 4))  # Quarterly compounding
print(oet(0.10, 2))  # Semiannual compounding
```

**Output:**

```
0.06084614717124706
0.07184372786869348
0.1036496403341637
```
