Let's consider the problem statement:

Write a Python code to solve the problem of generating tables with powers of 2, 3, and 5 for a given positive integer n. The program must use only basic iterations of sequences in loops and no data structures except for the iteration loop.

Here is a solution:
```
n = int(input("Enter an integer value for n: "))
while n > 0:
    print(pow(2, i), pow(3, i), pow(5, i))
    i += 1
```
The input prompt asks the user to enter a positive integer n. The output table will display the first n powers of 2, 3, and 5.
