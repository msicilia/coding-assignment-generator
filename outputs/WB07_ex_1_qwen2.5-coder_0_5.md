Thoughts:

To implement a program that calculates the product of two numbers using recursion and avoids using the multiplication operator, we can define a recursive function `recursive_product`. This function will take two parameters, `a` and `b`, and recursively add `a` to itself `b` times (or vice versa if `b` is negative).

Here's the implementation:

```python
def recursive_product(a, b):
    # Base case: if b is 0, the product is 0
    if b == 0:
        return 0
    
    # If b is negative, make it positive and negate the result at the end
    if b < 0:
        return -recursive_product(a, -b)
    
    # Recursive case: add a to the product of a and (b-1)
    return a + recursive_product(a, b - 1)

# Read numbers from the keyboard
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the product using the recursive function
result = recursive_product(num1, num2)

# Print the result
print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is {result}")
```

Explanation:

1. The `recursive_product` function takes two parameters: `a` (the number to be added) and `b` (the number of times to add).
2. The base case checks if `b` is 0. If it is, the product is 0.
3. If `b` is negative, we recursively call the function with the absolute value of `b` and negate the result at the end.
4. In the recursive case, we add `a` to the product of `a` and `(b-1)`.

This implementation correctly handles both positive and negative numbers and avoids using the multiplication operator by using recursion and addition only.

Example test cases:

```python
# Test with positive numbers
num1 = 3
num2 = 4
result = recursive_product(num1, num2)
print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is {result}")  # Output: The product of 3 and 4 is 12

# Test with negative numbers
num1 = -5
num2 = 6
result = recursive_product(num1, num2)
print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is {result}")  # Output: The product of -5 and 6 is -30

# Test with zero
num1 = 7
num2 = 0
result = recursive_product(num1, num2)
print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is {result}")  # Output: The product of 7 and 0 is 0

# Test with zero as the first number
num1 = 0
num2 = -8
result = recursive_product(num1, num2)
print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is {result}")  # Output: The product of 0 and -8 is 0
```

This implementation satisfies all the requirements mentioned in the problem statement and provides a correct solution for calculating the product of two numbers recursively without using the multiplication operator.
