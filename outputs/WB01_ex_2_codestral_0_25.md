 Thinking: I have written Python code that calculates the tax payable based on the given conditions without using any functions or input() calls. The code first defines the annual income, number of sons, personal deduction, and additional deduction per son. It then calculates the total income after the deductions to find the taxable income. Finally, it calculates the tax payable by taking one third of the taxable income.

   Answer: The tax payable for a taxpayer with an annual income of €15000 and 2 sons is €4760.0 (calculated as follows: Total income after deductions = €15000 - €600 - (€60 * 2) = €13800; Taxable income = €13800; Tax payable = one third of the taxable income = €4760.0).

   Code explanation: The provided code defines variables for annual income, number of sons, personal deduction, and additional deduction per son. It calculates the total income after deductions by subtracting the personal deduction and the product of the additional deduction and the number of sons from the annual income. Then it calculates the taxable income as equal to this total income after deductions. Finally, it calculates the tax payable as one third of the taxable income and prints out this value.
