Thoughts:
It seems there was an error in parsing my previous response. Let me correct it and provide the required code snippet again, ensuring it follows the expected format.
```python
# Your python code here
```
Code:
```py
def force(mass, acceleration):
    return mass * acceleration

def test_force():
    print(f"Test Case 1: Mass = 10.0 kg, Acceleration = 9.81 m/s^2 -> Force = {force(10.0, 9.81)} N")
    print(f"Test Case 2: Mass = 5.0 kg, Acceleration = 3.0 m/s^2 -> Force = {force(5.0, 3.0)} N")
    print(f"Test Case 3: Mass = 0.0 kg, Acceleration = 10.0 m/s^2 -> Force = {force(0.0, 10.0)} N")

test_force()
```
Thoughts:
This code defines a `force` function that calculates the force given mass and acceleration using basic arithmetic operations. The `test_force` function demonstrates how to use the `force` function with different inputs and prints the results. This approach adheres to the requirement of using only functions, avoiding data structures, loops, and conditional statements as specified.
