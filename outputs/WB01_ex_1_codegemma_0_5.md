```python
# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 4

# Calculate the area of the square using the formula
area = side_length * side_length

# Display the area of the square
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code defines a single variable called `side_length` with a value of 4.
* It calculates the area of the square using the formula `area = side_length * side_length`.
* Finally, it displays the area of the square using the `print()` function.

**Example Output:**

```
The area of the square is: 16
```
