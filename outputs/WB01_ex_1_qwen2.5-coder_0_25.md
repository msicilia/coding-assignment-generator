Thought: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of a square using a single variable. Since we are not allowed to use functions and `input()`, we can define a variable for the side length of the square and then compute its area by squaring that value. We will store the result in another variable.

Here is the Python code:

```py
# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 5

# Calculate the area of the square using the side length
area = side_length ** 2

# Display the area of the square
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```

This code defines a variable `side_length` with a value of 5, calculates the area by squaring this value and stores it in another variable `area`, and then prints the result.

### Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1: Side length = 5**
   - Expected Output: The area of the square is: 25

2. **Test Case 2: Side length = 3**
   - Expected Output: The area of the square is: 9

3. **Test Case 3: Side length = 10**
   - Expected Output: The area of the square is: 100

### Explanation:
- We use a single variable `side_length` to store the side length of the square.
- We calculate the area by squaring `side_length` using the exponentiation operator `**`.
- We store the result in the variable `area`.
- Finally, we print the area of the square.

This solution adheres to all the given constraints and requirements. The code is simple, straightforward, and meets the requirement of displaying the area of a square using a single variable without using functions or input().
