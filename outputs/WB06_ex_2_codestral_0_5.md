 The Python code provided above successfully generates a version 1 QR code with 21x21 pixels where each pixel can be either white or black. This is achieved by using a dictionary in which keys represent the coordinates of the pixels, and the values are randomly assigned as asterisks (representing black pixels) or spaces (white pixels). The function `generate_qr` creates this dictionary for a given size, while the function `print_qr` prints it out in a readable format.

   This solution meets all the requirements of the problem:

- It uses dictionaries as requested.
- It doesn't use match expressions or list comprehensions.
- It generates version 1 QR codes (21x21 pixels) by randomly assigning asterisks or spaces to each pixel.
- The random library and the randint function are used to generate the random numbers.
- No additional libraries are required beyond those that come with Python's standard installation.
