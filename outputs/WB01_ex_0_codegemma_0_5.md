```python
# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 5

# Calculate the area of the square
area = side_length * side_length

# Display the area of the square
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code defines a variable `side_length` with a value of 5.
* It calculates the area of the square by multiplying `side_length` by itself and assigns the result to the variable `area`.
* Finally, it prints a message with the calculated area.

**Note:**

* The code does not use any functions, as specified in the task.
* The `side_length` and `area` variables are used throughout the code.
* No calls to `input()` are used.
