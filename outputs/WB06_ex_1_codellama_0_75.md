  You are correct. The previous answer was incorrect.
The correct solution is to use the `in` operator to check if each element in the list is present in the dictionary or not. If it's present, then we add its value to the first output list, otherwise we add it to the second output list. Here's the corrected code:
```python
def get_in_and_out(my_dict, my_list):
    in_dict = []
    not_in_dict = []
    for element in my_list:
        if element in my_dict:
            in_dict.append(my_dict[element])
        else:
            not_in_dict.append(element)
    return in_dict, not_in_dict
```
Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
>>> my_list = ["a", "b", "d"]
>>> get_in_and_out(my_dict, my_list)
([1, 2], ['d'])
```
