```python
# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 5  # replace with any value to test different cases

# Calculate and store the area in a variable
area = side_length * side_length

# Display the result
print(f"The area of the square is {area} square units.")
```
This code will calculate the area of a square given its side length, and then print this value to the console.
