 Based on the execution logs, the Python code has successfully implemented and tested the 'force' function according to the problem statement. The function correctly calculates the physical quantity 'force' as the product of 'mass' and 'acceleration', which is in line with Newton's second law of motion.

   The 'test_force' function was used to test the 'force' function with multiple test cases, including:
- Mass = 10kg, Acceleration = 5m/s², resulting in Force = 50N (Newtons)
- Mass = 2kg, Acceleration = 9.8m/s², resulting in Force = 19.6N
- Mass = 7.3kg, Acceleration = 6m/s², resulting in Force = 43.8N

   The code follows good practices of modularity by encapsulating the 'force' calculation and testing within their respective functions. Therefore, the provided Python code is a valid solution to the problem statement that meets all the given requirements.
