```python
# Example purchase amount
purchase_amount = float("120")

# Example payment method
payment_method = "cash"

# Calculate discount
if payment_method == "cash":
    discount = 0.05
else:
    discount = 0.02

# Calculate discounted amount
discounted_amount = purchase_amount * (1 - discount)

# Print discounted amount
print("Discounted amount:", discounted_amount)
```

**Observations:**

* The code correctly calculates the discounted amount based on the purchase amount and payment method.
