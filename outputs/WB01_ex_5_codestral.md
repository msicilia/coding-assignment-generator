 Based on the provided Python code snippet, it successfully calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its length and breadth without using any functions or input calls. For example, with a rectangle that has a length of 10 units and a breadth of 5 units, the area is calculated as 50 square units (length * breadth) and the perimeter is calculated as 30 units (2 * (length + breadth)). The results are then displayed on the screen.
