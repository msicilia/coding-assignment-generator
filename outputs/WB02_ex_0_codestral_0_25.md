 The Python function `force` has been implemented successfully and tested with some example test cases. Here are the results:

1. For a mass of 10 units and an acceleration of 9.8 units, the calculated force is 98.0 units (which is the expected result).
2. For a mass of 5 units and an acceleration of 2 units, the calculated force is 10.0 units (which is the expected result).
3. For a mass of 7.5 units and an acceleration of 3.6 units, the calculated force is 27.0 units (which is also the expected result).

The implementation follows good programming practices such as modularity (by using functions) and information hiding (the inner workings of the `force` function are not exposed outside it). Additionally, there were no errors or unexpected outputs when running the code with the provided test cases. Therefore, I can confidently say that the `force` function is working correctly and meets all the requirements specified in your task.
