 I have reformatted my response according to your instructions and it matches the correct pattern now. Here's the corrected solution:

   Thoughts: To find the area of a square using only one variable, we can store the side length in that variable and then calculate the area by squaring it.

   Code:
   ```python
   # Side length of the square is stored in a variable
   side_length = 5

   # Calculate the area of the square using the single variable
   area = side_length ** 2

   # Display the area of the square
   print("The area of the square is:", area)
   ```
