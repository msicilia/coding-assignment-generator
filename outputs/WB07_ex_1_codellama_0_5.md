 
You are correct. I apologize for my previous mistakes. Here is the corrected code that should run without any issues:
```
def recursive_multiplication(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return a + recursive_multiplication(a, b - 1)
```
To test this function, you can use the following code:
```
assert recursive_multiplication(2, 3) == 6
assert recursive_multiplication(5, 4) == 20
assert recursive_multiplication(8, 9) == 72
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
