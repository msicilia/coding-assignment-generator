 The Python code provided earlier is a solution that calculates various costs related to a truck on a trip. Here's a summary of what the code does:

1. It defines four variables: `distance_travelled`, `diesel_used`, `cost_per_litre`, and `other_costs`. These variables store the distance travelled in kilometers, the litres of diesel used, the cost per litre of diesel, and other costs associated with maintaining the truck.
2. It calculates the kilometres travelled per litre by dividing the total distance travelled by the litres of diesel used. The result is stored in the `km_per_litre` variable.
3. Next, it calculates the total cost of the trip by adding the cost of the diesel used to the other costs associated with maintaining the truck. The result is stored in the `total_cost` variable.
4. Finally, it calculates the total cost per kilometre (including maintenance costs) by dividing the total cost of the trip by the distance travelled. The result is stored in the `total_cost_per_km` variable.
5. Finally, it prints out the calculated values for kilometers travelled per litre, total cost of the trip, and total cost per kilometre.

The code meets all the requirements mentioned: it uses variables instead of input() to read data, and it does not use functions or other restricted Python elements.
