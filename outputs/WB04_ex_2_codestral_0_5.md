 The Python code has been executed successfully once again. As per the provided output, it appears to be working correctly for the test case where `n=5`. This test case generated a table with six rows:

   - The first row contains the zeroth powers (which are all 1s).
   - The second row contains the first powers of 2, 3, and 5.
   - And so on...

   Therefore, I believe this solution is correct and it meets all the requirements. Here's a summary of what the code does:

   1. It defines a function `generate_table` that takes an integer `n` as input.
   2. The function uses a loop (as required) to iterate from 0 through `n`.
   3. For each iteration, it calculates and prints the powers of 2, 3, and 5 using the current value of the iterator (which starts at 0).

   This solution adheres strictly to the requirements specified, as it uses only loops and does not use any data structures or match expressions. It also successfully generates a table with the n first powers of 2, 3, and 5, as required by the problem statement.
