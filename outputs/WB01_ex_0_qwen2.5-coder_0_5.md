Thought: To solve this problem, I need to create two variables: one for the side length of the square and another for the area. The area can be calculated by multiplying the side length by itself. Finally, I will display the area using a print statement.

Code:
```py
# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 5

# Calculate the area of the square
area = side_length * side_length

# Display the area of the square
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```

Example Test Case 1:
```python
# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 3

# Calculate the area of the square
area = side_length * side_length

# Display the area of the square
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```
Expected Output: The area of the square is: 9

Example Test Case 2:
```python
# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 10

# Calculate the area of the square
area = side_length * side_length

# Display the area of the square
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```
Expected Output: The area of the square is: 100

Example Test Case 3:
```python
# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 0.5

# Calculate the area of the square
area = side_length * side_length

# Display the area of the square
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```
Expected Output: The area of the square is: 0.25
