Here is an example Python code to solve the problem:
```py
# Input values for amount in euros and exchange rate
euros = float(input("Enter amount in euros: "))
exchange_rate = float(input("Enter exchange rate: "))

# Calculate equivalent amount in pounds
pounds = euros * exchange_rate

# Print result
print("The equivalent amount in pounds is", pounds)
```
This code asks the user to input the amount in euros and the exchange rate, and then calculates the equivalent amount in pounds by multiplying the two values together. Finally, it prints the result to the console.

Note that this code does not use any functions, but instead uses the basic arithmetic operators and the `input()` function to read user input and print output. Additionally, no test cases are provided as part of the question.
