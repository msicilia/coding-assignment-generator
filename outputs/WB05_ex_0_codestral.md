 The Python code has been executed successfully. It defines a function called `sum_lists` which takes in two parameters, `list1` and `list2`. This function checks if both input lists have the same length. If not, it returns an error message "Error: Lists are not of equal length".

   The function then initializes an empty list `result`, and a counter variable `i`. It uses a while loop to iterate through each index in the input lists. For each iteration, it adds the corresponding elements from both lists and appends this sum to the `result` list. Finally, it returns the `result` list which contains the sum of the original lists element by element.

   The code also includes two test cases:
   - Test Case 1: Summing [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6], expecting output [5, 7, 9].
   - Test Case 2: Summing [0, -2, 3] and [-1, 5, -6], expecting output [-1, 3, -3].

   Both test cases have produced the expected results. Therefore, we can conclude that the `sum_lists` function is working correctly as per your requirements.
