 The Python code provided calculates the net salary for a salesperson based on the problem's requirements. In this case, the salesperson had total sales of 50,000 euros during the last month. After calculating the commission (3% of total sales) and adding it to the basic salary of 2,000 euros, we obtain the gross income. Subsequently, the code deducts the income tax (32% of gross income) from the gross income to find the net salary. The result is that the salesperson's net salary for the last month will be â‚¬2,380.
