 Thought: The task requires calculating the equivalent amount in GBP given an amount in EUR and an exchange rate with a 2% commission applied. Since we can't use functions, I will perform this calculation directly using variables. The code will multiply the euros by the exchange rate to get pounds, calculate the commission as 2% of the pounds, add the commission to the pounds, and then print the final amount in GBP.

   Code:
   ```py
   # Variables for the amounts and exchange rate
   euros = 100  # replace with any value for testing
   exchange_rate = 0.85  # replace this with today's exchange rate for testing

   # Calculations
   pounds = euros * exchange_rate
   commission = pounds * 0.02
   final_amount_GBP = pounds + commission

   # Print the result
   print("The equivalent amount in Pounds Sterling (GBP) is:", final_amount_GBP)
   ```
