 Thoughts: I will write a Python subprogram that takes a time string in 24-hour notation as an argument and returns the same time in 12-hour notation. To solve this problem, I will split the input time string into hours and minutes, convert the hour to a number type, and use conditional statements to determine whether it's AM or PM. Afterward, I will adjust the hour if necessary (for times after noon) and format the output string accordingly. If any errors occur during this process, such as invalid input strings or out-of-range values, I will use a try-except block to handle them appropriately.

   Code:
```py
def convert_time(time_24h):
    try:
        hour, minute = map(int, time_24h.split(':'))
        if not (0 <= hour < 24 and 0 <= minute < 60):
            raise ValueError("Invalid time value")
        am_pm = "AM" if hour < 12 else "PM"
        hour %= 12
        hour = 12 if hour == 0 else hour
        return f"{hour}:{minute:02d} {am_pm}"
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)

# Testing the subprogram with various test cases
test_cases = ["23:45", "13:30", "09:00", "abc", "24:00", "-1:-1"]
for time in test_cases:
    print(f"{time} -> {convert_time(time)}")
```
