 In this problem, we need to write two Python functions: `m_to_barn` for converting square meters (mÂ²) to barns, and `barn_to_m` for the inverse conversion. Since the solution should follow good programming practices of modularity, information hiding, and function usage, it is essential to define these functions separately instead of using loops or conditional statements.

   Here are the Python functions that solve this problem:

```python
def m_to_barn(square_meters):
    """Convert square meters to barns."""
    return square_meters / 1e-28

def barn_to_m(barns):
    """Convert barns to square meters."""
    return barns * 1e-28
```

   To test these functions, we can use the following example:

```python
# Test cases
area_m = 100  # Square meters
area_barn = m_to_barn(area_m)
area_m_back = barn_to_m(area_barn)

print("Original area in square meters:", area_m)
print("Converted area in barns:", area_barn)
print("Converted back to square meters:", area_m_back)
```

   This example will convert an area of 100 square meters to barns and then convert it back to square meters. The output should show that the original and final values are equal to each other, which indicates that the conversion process is successful.
