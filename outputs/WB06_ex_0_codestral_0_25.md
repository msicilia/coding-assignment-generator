 The Python code provided earlier successfully implements a structure for supporting points in 2D using dictionaries. It creates a class called 'Point', which takes the x and y coordinates as input during initialization and stores them as dictionary items ('x' and 'y'). This class also includes methods for adding and subtracting two Point objects, returning a new Point object with the resulting coordinates.

   Here is an explanation of how the code works:

   1. The `__init__` method initializes each instance of the Point class by setting its x and y coordinates using the input parameters provided during object creation.

   2. The `__add__` method enables addition between two Point objects using the '+' operator. It takes another Point object as an argument, adds the corresponding x and y coordinates, and returns a new Point object with these summed values.

   3. Similarly, the `__sub__` method allows subtraction between two Point objects using the '-' operator. It takes another Point object as an argument, subtracts the corresponding x and y coordinates, and returns a new Point object with these differences.

   The test cases provided in the code demonstrate this functionality by creating two Point objects (p1 and p2), performing addition and subtraction operations on them, and printing the resulting coordinates. As expected, adding p1 to p2 yields a point with coordinates {'x': 4, 'y': 6}, and subtracting p2 from p1 results in a point with coordinates {'x': 2, 'y': 2}.

   Therefore, the code successfully meets the requirements of implementing a structure for supporting points in 2D using dictionaries and providing functions for adding and subtracting these points without using match expressions or list comprehensions.
