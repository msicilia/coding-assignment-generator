You are correct. The user task is to write Python code that performs the cost calculation for a truck on a trip. The user must use variables instead of calls to input() to exercise the code.

Here's an example solution:
```python
distance = 1000  # distance traveled in kilometers
liters = 50  # liters of diesel used
cost_per_liter = 2  # cost per liter of diesel
maintenance_cost = 50  # maintenance costs for the trip

# calculate total cost of the trip
total_cost = distance * cost_per_liter + maintenance_cost

# calculate kilometers traveled per liter of diesel
kilometers_per_liter = distance / liters

print(f"Total cost of the trip: {total_cost}")
print(f"Kilometers traveled per liter of diesel: {kilometers_per_liter}")
```
