 Thought: The task is simple and can be solved without using functions as required. I will declare two variables for width and height of the rectangle. Then, I will calculate the area by multiplying these two variables and the perimeter by adding twice their sum. Finally, I will print out the calculated area and perimeter.

   Code:
   ```python
   # Declare width and height
   width = 5
   height = 3

   # Calculate area
   area = width * height

   # Calculate perimeter
   perimeter = 2 * (width + height)

   # Print out the results
   print('Area:', area)
   print('Perimeter:', perimeter)
   ```
