Here is an example Python script that meets your requirements:

```python
# Define the side length variable
side_length = 5

# Calculate the area by multiplying the side length by itself
area = side_length * side_length

# Print out the calculated area
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```
When run, this script will display `'The area of the square is: 25'`.
