Here is an answer to the user task:
```
x = 3.5
y = 4.2
z = 5.1

mean = (x + y + z) / 3
sum_total = x + y + z
product_total = x * y * z

print("The mean is:", mean)
print("The sum total is:", sum_total)
print("The product total is:", product_total)
```
This program calculates the mean, sum total and product total of three real numbers, `x`, `y` and `z`, and displays them on the screen using the print function. The variables `i`, `j` and `k` are used to store the values of these numbers, but they are not needed for this program.

To avoid the error mentioned in the previous task, you can use the `format` method to print the values. Here's an example of how to do it:
```
print("The mean is: {}".format(mean))
```
This is a common mistake that many beginners make. To avoid this kind of errors in the future, you can use the `format` method to print the values. Here's an example of how to do it:
```
print("The mean is: {}".format(mean))
```
In this case, the curly braces are used to specify where the value of the variable should be inserted in the string. This makes the code more readable and avoids errors like the one you encountered.
