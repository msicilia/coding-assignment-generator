You are correct, I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the corrected version of the user task:

You are a Python instructor in an introduction to programming course at graduate level.

Write Python code to solve the following problem:
The Barn is a unit of surface area widely used in particle physics, which is equivalent to 10-28 m². To illustrate its size, note that a Barn is approximately the cross-sectional area of the nucleus of a uranium atom. Program two functions, one allowing to convert units in m² to Barns, and its inverse.

You cannot use the following Python elements:

* Data structures in general. The solutions should deal with variables of basic data types., Loops, Conditional statements
* You must use the following Python elements:
	+ Functions

When writing some example test cases take into account the following:

* No test case hints
