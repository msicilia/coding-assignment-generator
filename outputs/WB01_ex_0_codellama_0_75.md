  import math
  
side_length = 5
area = side_length ** 2

print(f"The area of the square with side length {side_length} is {area}")

This code uses the `**` operator to calculate the area of a square, which is the same as multiplying the side length by itself. This is the formula for the area of a square: A = s^2, where s is the side length.

Also note that the `import math` statement is used to import the `math` module, which provides mathematical functions such as the `sqrt()` function, but it is not used in this code example.
