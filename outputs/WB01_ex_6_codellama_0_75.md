To write a Python program that calculates the mean, sum total, and product total of three real numbers without using any built-in functions, you can use the following code:
```python
# Initialize three real variables
x = 10.5
y = 20.8
z = 30.3

# Calculate the mean, sum total, and product total
mean = (x + y + z) / 3
sum_total = x + y + z
product_total = x * y * z

# Display the results on the screen
print("The mean is:", mean)
print("The sum total is:", sum_total)
print("The product total is:", product_total)
```
This code uses only basic Python syntax to calculate and display the mean, sum total, and product total of three real numbers. The `x`, `y`, and `z` variables are initialized with the given values, and then the `mean`, `sum_total`, and `product_total` variables are calculated using simple arithmetic operations. Finally, the results are displayed on the screen using the `print()` function.
