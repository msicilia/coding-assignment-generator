```python
# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 7

# Calculate the area of the square
area = side_length ** 2

# Display the area of the square
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code starts by defining the side length of the square to be 7.
* It then calculates the area of the square by squaring the side length using the `**` operator.
* Finally, it prints the area of the square to the console using the `print()` function.

**Output:**

```
The area of the square is: 49
```

**Conclusion:**

The provided code snippet successfully calculates and displays the area of a square using a single variable. It meets all the requirements specified in the task.
