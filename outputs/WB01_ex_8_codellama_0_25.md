  The problem statement provides all the necessary information to write a Python program to calculate the net salary of a salesperson. Here's an example solution:
```
# Define basic salary and commission rate
basic_salary = 2000
commission_rate = 3/100

# Calculate total sales made by the salesperson during the last month
total_sales = 500

# Calculate income tax deducted from total sales
income_tax = total_sales * commission_rate / 100

# Calculate net salary by subtracting income tax from basic salary and adding commission
net_salary = basic_salary - income_tax + (total_sales * commission_rate)

print(f"Net salary: {net_salary} euros")
```
This program first defines the basic salary, commission rate, and total sales made by the salesperson during the last month. It then calculates the income tax deducted from the total sales based on the commission rate. Finally, it calculates the net salary by subtracting the income tax from the basic salary and adding the commission. The resulting value is printed to the screen.
Note that this program uses Python's built-in arithmetic operators and string formatting to perform mathematical operations and generate output.
