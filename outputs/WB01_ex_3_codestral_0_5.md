 Thought:
I will write Python code to solve the problem using only basic assignments and expressions without using functions or input statements as per your request. The code will calculate the total seconds elapsed since midnight and the seconds remaining until the next midnight for a given time expressed in hours, minutes, and seconds.

Code:
```python
# Define variables for hours, minutes, and seconds
hours = 10
minutes = 35
seconds = 47

# Calculate total elapsed seconds since midnight
total_elapsed_seconds = (hours * 60 * 60) + (minutes * 60) + seconds

# Calculate total remaining seconds until next midnight
total_remaining_seconds = (24 * 60 * 60) - total_elapsed_seconds

print("Total elapsed seconds since last midnight: ", total_elapsed_seconds)
print("Total remaining seconds until next midnight: ", total_remaining_seconds)
```
