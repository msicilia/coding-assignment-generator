Thought: To solve this problem without using functions or input(), we need to define variables for the amount in Euros, the exchange rate, and the commission rate. We will then calculate the total amount after adding the commission and convert it to Pounds Sterling. Finally, we will print the result with two decimal places.

Code:
```py
# Define the exchange rate (EUR to GBP)
exchange_rate = 0.85

# Define the commission rate (2%)
commission_rate = 0.02

# Define the amount in Euros
amount_eur = 1000

# Calculate the total amount after adding the commission
total_amount_with_commission = amount_eur * (1 + commission_rate)

# Convert the total amount to Pounds Sterling
amount_gbp = total_amount_with_commission * exchange_rate

# Print the result
print("The equivalent in pounds is: {:.2f} GBP".format(amount_gbp))
```

Explanation:
- We define the exchange rate, commission rate, and amount in Euros as variables.
- We calculate the total amount after adding the commission by multiplying the amount in Euros by (1 + commission_rate).
- We convert the total amount to Pounds Sterling by multiplying it by the exchange rate.
- Finally, we print the result using the `print` function with formatted string to ensure two decimal places.

This code snippet adheres to the requirements and avoids using functions or input() calls.
