Thought: To solve this problem, I need to define variables for the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. Then, using these variables, I can calculate both the area and the perimeter of the rectangle. Finally, I will display these calculated values on the screen without using functions.

Code:
```py
# Define the length and width of the rectangle
length = 10
width = 5

# Calculate the area of the rectangle
area = length * width

# Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

# Display the area and perimeter on the screen
print("Area:", area)
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
```

This code defines the variables `length` and `width`, calculates the area and perimeter using these variables, and then prints the results to the screen. This solution adheres to the requirements by not using functions and instead using direct variable definitions and calculations.
