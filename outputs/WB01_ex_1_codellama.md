  The task is to write Python code to calculate the area of a square with a side length of 10 using a single variable. Since you cannot use functions, the only way to achieve this is by using a variable to store the value of the square's side length and then calculating the area using the formula `area = side_length * side_length`. Here's an example of how you could do this:
```python
# Define a variable to store the value of the square's side length
side_length = 10

# Calculate the area of the square
area = side_length * side_length

# Print the result
print(area)
```
This code should output `100`, which is the area of a square with a side length of `10`.
