Thought: It seems the previous attempt was successful in calculating and displaying the sum, mean, and product of the three real numbers. Since we are not allowed to use functions and must directly use variables, the provided code is correct and meets all the requirements.

```py
# Initialize three real numbers
x = 3.5
y = 2.1
z = 4.8

# Calculate the sum total
sum_total = x + y + z

# Calculate the mean
mean = sum_total / 3

# Calculate the product total
product_total = x * y * z

# Display all these data on the screen
print("Sum Total:", sum_total)
print("Mean:", mean)
print("Product Total:", product_total)
```
