Here is a Python code snippet which implements the described functionality:

```python
# Initialize your numbers here
x = 5.36  # You can replace these values with any real number you want.
y = 7.84   
z = 9.12    

# Declare integer variables for calculation purposes
i = int(x)
j = int(y)
k = int(z)
n = i + j + k # Sum total of the integers
m = n / 3.0   # Mean of the real numbers
p = x * y * z  # Product total of the real numbers

print('The sum total of the numbers is: ', n)
print('The mean of the numbers is: ', m)
print('The product total of the numbers is: ', p)
```
