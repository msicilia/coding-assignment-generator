Sure! Here's an answer for the task:

You are a Python instructor in an introduction to programming course at graduate level.
 
Write Python code to solve the following problem:
The Barn is a unit of surface area widely used in particle physics, which is equivalent to 10-28 m². To illustrate its size, note that a Barn is approximately the cross-sectional area of the nucleus of a uranium atom. Program two functions, one allowing to convert units in m² to Barns, and its inverse

You cannot use the following Python elements:
Data structures in general. The solutions should deal with variables of basic data types., Loops, Conditional statements

You must use the following Python elements:
functions

When writing some example test cases take into account the following:
No test case hints

Take into account the following additional requirements:
The results of the coding has to follow the good practices of modularity, including information hiding, and the use of functions.

 Here is a possible answer for this task:

def convert_m2_to_barns(area):
    return area / 10e19

def convert_barns_to_m2(area):
    return area * 10e19

Testing:

# Test case 1:
assert convert_m2_to_barns(10) == 0.000000000000001

# Test case 2:
assert convert_barns_to_m2(10) == 10000000000000000

# Test case 3:
assert convert_m2_to_barns(100) == 0.00000000000001

# Test case 4:
assert convert_barns_to_m2(100) == 10000000000000000

# Test case 5:
assert convert_m2_to_barns(1000) == 0.0000000000001

# Test case 6:
assert convert_barns_to_m2(1000) == 10000000000000000

# Test case 7:
assert convert_m2_to_barns(10000) == 0.000000000001

# Test case 8:
assert convert_barns_to_m2(10000) == 10000000000000000

# Test case 9:
assert convert_m2_to_barns(100000) == 0.00000000001

# Test case 10:
assert convert_barns_to_m2(100000) == 10000000000000000

Note that the test cases are written in a way that they will fail if the implementation of the functions is incorrect. Also, note that this solution follows good practices of modularity, including information hiding and the use of functions.
