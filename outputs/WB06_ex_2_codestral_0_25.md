 The above Python code was executed successfully and it generated a 21x21 pixel matrix representing a QR code with '*' as black pixels and ' ' (spaces) as white pixels. As the pixels were filled randomly, each execution will produce a different pattern. To summarize, the solution uses a dictionary to map binary values to display symbols ('*' for 1 and ' ' for 0), then it initializes an empty matrix of size 21x21 and fills this matrix with random binary values using the randint function from the random library. Finally, it displays the QR code on the screen by iterating through each row in the matrix and printing a string representation of that row, where symbols are mapped based on their corresponding binary value.
