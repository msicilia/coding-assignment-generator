```python
# Define the variables for the length and width of the rectangle
length = 5
width = 3

# Calculate the area of the rectangle
area = length * width

# Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

# Display the area and perimeter on the screen
print("Area:", area)
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
```

**Output:**

```
Area: 15
Perimeter: 16
```

**Note:**

* The code uses variables `length` and `width` to represent the dimensions of the rectangle.
* The `area` variable stores the calculated area.
* The `perimeter` variable stores the calculated perimeter.
* The `print()` statements display the area and perimeter on the screen.
