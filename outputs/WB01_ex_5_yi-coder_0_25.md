Here is one way you could solve this problem:
```python
# Define variables for the lengths of the sides of the rectangle
length = 10
width = 5

# Calculate the area
area = length * width

# Calculate the perimeter
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

# Print the results
print("The area is:", area)
print("The perimeter is:", perimeter)
```
