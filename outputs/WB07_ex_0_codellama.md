 
Here's an updated version of the code with the corrected regex pattern:
```py
def check_number(my_list, target):
    if len(my_list) == 0:
        return False
    elif my_list[0] == target:
        return True
    else:
        return check_number(my_list[1:], target)
```
And here are the test cases with the correct output for each case:

1. Test case 1: The input list is empty, and we are looking for the number 5. Since the list is empty, we return False.
2. Test case 2: The input list contains only three numbers (1, 2, and 3), but we are looking for the number 5. Therefore, we return False.
3. Test case 3: The input list contains the number 3, which is what we are looking for. Therefore, we return True.
4. Test case 4: The input list contains all five numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), so we return True.

Now, let's provide an answer to the given user task:
You are a Python instructor in an introduction to programming course at graduate level.
 
Write Python code to solve the following problem:
Program a recursive procedure that checks whether or not a certain number is found in a list.

You cannot use the following Python elements:
match expressions, list comprehensions

You must use the following Python elements:
Recursive function calls.

When writing some example test cases take into account the following:
No test case hints

Take into account the following additional requirements:
No additional requirements.
