You are given the following problem to solve using Python:

Write a program that reads a positive integer n and generates a table with the n first powers of 2, 3 and 5.

Constraints:

* You cannot use any data structures in Python except for basic iterations of sequences in loops.
* You must use only loops to solve this problem.

Input Format:

A single positive integer n denoting the number of rows in the table you want to generate.

Output Format:

The generated table with the first n powers of 2, 3 and 5. Each row should be printed on a new line.

Sample Input 0:

10

Sample Output 0:

1
2
4
8
16
32
64
128
256
512
1024

Explanation 0:

The first 10 powers of 2, 3 and 5 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024. The program prints each of these numbers on a new line in the output.

Hint:
You can use the pow() function in Python to calculate powers.
