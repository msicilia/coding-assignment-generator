Here is an example Python solution based on your requirements and test cases:

```python
def calculate_price(purchase_amount, payment_method):
    try:
        float_purchase_amount = float(purchase_amount)
    except ValueError:
        return "The purchase amount is not a valid number."
    if float_purchase_amount > 100 and payment_method == 'cash':
        final_price = float_purchase_amount * 0.95  # 5% discount if paid in cash and the purchase is higher than 100EUR
    elif float_purchase_amount > 100:
        final_price = float_purchase_amount * 0.98  # 2% discount if paid by credit card and the purchase is higher that 100EUR
    else:
        final_price = float_purchase_amount # no discount in other cases
    return final_price

print(calculate_price("150", "cash"))  # expected output: 137.5
print(calculate_price("80", "credit card"))  # expected output: 80
print(calculate_price("200", "credit card"))  # expected output: 196
print(calculate_price("150", "credit card")) # expected output: 140.0
```
