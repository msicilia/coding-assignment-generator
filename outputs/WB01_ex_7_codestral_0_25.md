 I have provided Python code to solve the problem as described. The code converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa without using functions or input() calls. It defines two variables: `temperature_fahrenheit` and `temperature_celsius`. After assigning values to these variables, it performs the necessary calculations and prints out the equivalent temperature in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. Here's how the code works:

1. Converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius: The formula used is `(temperature_fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9`. For example, with `temperature_fahrenheit` equal to 100 degrees, the equivalent temperature in Celsius is calculated and printed out.

2. Converting from Celsius to Fahrenheit: The formula used is `(temperature_celsius * 9 / 5) + 32`. For example, with `temperature_celsius` equal to 40 degrees, the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit is calculated and printed out.

   The code successfully computes and prints the temperatures as expected based on the provided formula.
