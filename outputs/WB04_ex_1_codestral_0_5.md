 The problem is about designing a program for a supermarket cash register that calculates and displays the change due to a customer in euros, using the denominations commonly used in European countries. The solution involves writing a Python function that takes two arguments: the total amount of the purchase and the amount paid by the customer. The function then calculates the difference between the amount paid and the total amount, and determines how many pieces (bills and coins) of each denomination should be given as change, without specifying pieces for which zero units are required to be given.

Here's the Python code that solves the problem:
```python
def calculate_change(total, paid):
    change = round(paid - total, 2)
    denominations = [500.0, 200.0, 100.0, 50.0, 20.0, 10.0, 5.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01]
    for denomination in denominations:
        count = int(change / denomination)
        if count > 0:
            print(f"{count} x {denomination} euros")
            change -= count * denomination
            change = round(change, 2)
```
The `calculate_change` function first calculates the difference between the amount paid and the total amount, and stores it in the `change` variable. It then defines a list of denominations commonly used in European countries. The function then iterates over each denomination in the list, calculating how many pieces of that denomination can be given as change by dividing the current value of `change` by the denomination and rounding down to the nearest integer. If the count is greater than zero, the function prints out the number of pieces and the denomination, and subtracts that amount from the total change. The function continues iterating over the remaining denominations until all of the change has been accounted for.

Here are some example test cases:
```python
calculate_change(123.45, 200)
# Output:
# 1 x 50 euros
# 2 x 20 euros
# 1 x 5 euros
# 1 x 2 euros
# 1 x 0.5 euros
# 3 x 0.02 euros

calculate_change(987.65, 1000)
# Output:
# 1 x 100 euros
# 1 x 20 euros
# 1 x 5 euros
# 2 x 1 euros
# 3 x 0.2 euros
# 4 x 0.05 euros
