 The Python code has successfully calculated the tax payable for a given annual income and number of sons. Based on an annual income of 8000 euros and having three sons, the tax payable is €2406.67. As a result, we can conclude that the code works as expected.

   For solving this problem:
   1. The total income (annual_income) and number of sons are assigned to variables.
   2. A personal deduction of €600 is defined, and an additional son-based deduction is calculated by multiplying the number of sons by 60 euros each.
   3. The taxable income is then determined by subtracting both deductions from the total income.
   4. Finally, the tax payable is computed as one third of the taxable income and printed out.
