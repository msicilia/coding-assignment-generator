Since you cannot use any function, we'll have to resort to hard-coding the calculation for the area of the square (Area = side^2). Here is an example:
```python
# Define the length of a side of the square
side = 5

# Calculate the area
area = side ** 2

print("The area of the square is:", area)
```
In this code snippet, we simply set 'side' to be equal to the length of one side of the square. Then, by using the exponentiation operator (**) with the value of 2, we are able to calculate the area of the square without using any function. The result is printed out at the end.
