 The Python function `is_number_in_list` has been defined and successfully tested with two examples. In both cases, the function correctly returned the expected output: it returned True when checking for the number 5 in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and False when checking for the number 6 in the same list. This is because the number 5 was present in the first list while the number 6 wasn't, as verified by the function's recursive search through the list. The function uses recursion to solve this problem without relying on match expressions or list comprehensions, as required.
