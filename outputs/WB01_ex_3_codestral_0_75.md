 Thoughts: I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. Let's solve this problem using Python without using functions or input() as per the constraints provided. Here's how to calculate the total seconds elapsed since the last midnight and the seconds remaining until the next midnight.

   Code:
   ```python
   # Given time in hours, minutes, and seconds
   given_hours = 12
   given_minutes = 30
   given_seconds = 45

   # Calculate total seconds elapsed since the last midnight
   total_seconds_elapsed = (given_hours * 3600) + (given_minutes * 60) + given_seconds

   # Calculate total seconds in a day
   total_seconds_in_day = 24 * 3600

   # Calculate remaining seconds until the next midnight
   remaining_seconds = total_seconds_in_day - total_seconds_elapsed

   print("Total seconds elapsed since last midnight:", total_seconds_elapsed)
   print("Remaining seconds until next midnight:", remaining_seconds)
   ```
