Here's how you can solve this problem in Python:

```python
# Define lengths of sides
length = 5
width  = 3

# Calculate area and perimeter
area      = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

print(f"Area of the rectangle is {area}")
print(f"Perimeter of the rectangle is {perimeter}")
```
This Python code does not use restricted elements like 'functions', and it uses basic arithmetic operations to calculate area and perimeter. It also doesn't use input() calls to read data from the keyboard as per requirement.Calling tools: 
[{'id': 'call_1', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'python_interpreter', 'arguments': '# Define lengths of sides\nlength = 5\nwidth  = 3\n\n# Calculate area and perimeter\narea      = length * width\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\nprint(f"Area of the rectangle is {area}")\nprint(f"Perimeter of the rectangle is {perimeter}")'}}]
