 The provided Python code calculates the net salary of a salesperson based on their basic salary, total sales made during the last month, commission rate, and tax rate. Here is how it works:

   1. Variables are defined to store the basic salary (2000 euros), example value of sales made in a month (50000 euros), commission rate (3% or 0.03), and tax rate (32% or 0.32). These values can be modified as needed to simulate different scenarios.
   2. The gross salary is calculated by adding the commission earned from the total sales made to the basic salary.
   3. The net salary is calculated by subtracting the income tax from the gross salary.
   4. Finally, the result is printed on the screen, showing the net salary that the salesperson will receive for that month. In this case, with the given example values, the net salary is 2380.0 euros.
