 Thought:
   I will calculate the area of a square by squaring its side length. Since functions are not allowed, I'll use a single variable for this task. The formula for the area of a square is side^2. I will define the side length and then calculate the area using that value. Finally, I will display the result.

   Code:
   ```python
   # Define the side length of the square
   side_length = 5

   # Calculate the area using the formula side^2
   area = side_length ** 2

   # Print the result
   print("The area of the square is:", area)
   ```
