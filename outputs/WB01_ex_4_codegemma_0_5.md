```python
# Define variables
distance_traveled = 500  # kilometers
liters_diesel_used = 250  # liters
cost_per_liter_diesel = 2.50  # dollars
maintenance_costs = 150  # dollars

# Calculate kilometers traveled per liter
kilometers_per_liter = distance_traveled / liters_diesel_used

# Calculate total cost of diesel
total_cost_diesel = liters_diesel_used * cost_per_liter_diesel

# Calculate total cost of trip
total_cost_trip = total_cost_diesel + maintenance_costs

# Calculate total cost per kilometer
total_cost_per_kilometer = total_cost_trip / distance_traveled

# Print results
print("Kilometers travelled per litre:", kilometers_per_liter)
print("Total cost of trip:", total_cost_trip)
print("Total cost per kilometre:", total_cost_per_kilometer)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code defines variables for distance traveled, liters of diesel used, cost per liter of diesel, and maintenance costs.
* It calculates the kilometers traveled per liter, total cost of diesel, total cost of the trip, and total cost per kilometer.
* Finally, it prints the results.

**Note:**

* This code does not use any functions.
* The variables are used to store the input data.
* The calculations are performed using the variables.
* The results are printed using the `print()` function.
