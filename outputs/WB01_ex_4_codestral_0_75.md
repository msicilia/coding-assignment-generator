 The previous execution didn't produce new code because the results were already calculated in a previous step. Based on the data provided: distance traveled = 500 km, liters used = 100 l, cost per liter = $2.5, and other maintenance costs = $300, we have the following calculations:

   - Kilometres travelled per litre: 5.0 km/l (calculated as distance traveled divided by liters used)
   - Total cost of the trip (including maintenance costs): $550.0 (calculated as liters used times cost per liter plus maintenance costs)
   - Total cost per kilometre (including maintenance costs): $1.1/km (calculated as total cost divided by distance traveled)
