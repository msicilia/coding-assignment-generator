  You are asked to write Python code without using any data structures, loops, or match expressions. The code should use conditional statements and try-except blocks.

To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Ask the seller for the amount of the purchase by setting a variable `amount` equal to the input provided by the seller. Make sure that the input is a valid number before proceeding with the calculations. You can use try-except blocks to check if the input can be converted to a float.
2. If the purchase amount is greater than 100EUR, apply a discount of 5% if the payment is made in cash and 2% if the payment is made by credit card. You can use conditional statements to determine which discount should be applied based on the payment method.
3. Calculate the final price of the purchase by multiplying the original amount by a discount factor. For example, if the discount factor is 0.05, the final price would be 95% of the original amount.
4. Print the final price to the console.

Here's an example code that meets the requirements:
```
# Ask the seller for the amount of the purchase
amount = input("Enter the amount of the purchase: ")
try:
    # Check if the input can be converted to a float
    amount = float(amount)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
    exit()

# Determine which discount should be applied based on the payment method
if payment_method == "cash":
    discount_factor = 0.05
elif payment_method == "credit card":
    discount_factor = 0.02
else:
    print("Invalid payment method. Please enter either 'cash' or 'credit card'.")
    exit()

# Calculate the final price of the purchase
final_price = amount * discount_factor

# Print the final price to the console
print(f"The final price of the purchase is {final_price:.2f}")
```
