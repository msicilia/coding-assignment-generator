  A Python instructor in an introduction to programming course at graduate level.
Write Python code to solve the following problem:
Implement a 'force' function that returns the value of the physical quantity force from the mass and acceleration values received as parameters. Then build a tester program by specifying the necessary test cases that displays the value of the force to from a given mass and acceleration.
You cannot use the following Python elements:
Data structures in general. The solutions should deal with variables of basic data types., Loops, Conditional statements
You must use the following Python elements:
functions
When writing some example test cases take into account the following:
No test case hints
Take into account the following additional requirements:
The results of the coding has to follow the good practices of modularity, including information hiding, and the use of functions.
