```python
total_income = 12000
number_of_sons = 2

personal_deduction = 600
son_deduction = 60 * number_of_sons

taxable_income = total_income - personal_deduction - son_deduction

tax_payable = taxable_income / 3

print("Tax payable:", tax_payable)
```

**Explanation:**

- The code calculates the personal deduction and son deduction based on the given values.
- It then calculates the taxable income by subtracting the personal and son deductions from the total income.
- Finally, it calculates the tax payable by dividing the taxable income by 3.
- The code prints the tax payable value to the console.

**Note:**

- This code does not use any functions, as specified in the task requirements.
- The code uses variables to store the input values and the calculated tax payable.
