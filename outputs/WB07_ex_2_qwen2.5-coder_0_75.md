Certainly! Below is the correct and complete code for a recursive function that counts the number of digits in a given integer. This function handles both positive and negative integers without using match expressions or list comprehensions.

### Code:
```py
def count_digits(n):
    # Base case: if the number is a single digit, return 1
    if abs(n) < 10:
        return 1
    else:
        # Recursive call with n divided by 10 (integer division)
        return 1 + count_digits(abs(n) // 10)

# Example test cases
print(count_digits(12345))  # Output: 5
print(count_digits(-6789))  # Output: 4
print(count_digits(0))      # Output: 1
print(count_digits(9))      # Output: 1
```

### Explanation:
- **Base Case**: If the absolute value of `n` is less than 10, it means `n` is a single digit. In this case, return 1.
- **Recursive Case**: For numbers with more than one digit, recursively call `count_digits` with `abs(n) // 10`. This reduces the number by one digit in each recursive call until it reaches the base case.

### Example Test Cases:
- `count_digits(12345)` returns 5 because there are five digits.
- `count_digits(-6789)` returns 4 because there are four digits.
- `count_digits(0)` returns 1 because zero is considered a single digit.
- `count_digits(9)` returns 1 because nine is also considered a single digit.

This implementation meets all the requirements specified in the task, including using only recursive function calls and not allowing match expressions or list comprehensions.
