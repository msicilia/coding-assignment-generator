 The code provided calculates the discounted price based on the amount of a purchase and the payment method. In this case, the purchase amount is '120' EUR and the payment method is cash. The code first converts the purchase amount from a string to a floating-point number. If the conversion is successful (i.e., if the input can be interpreted as a valid decimal number), the code checks whether the purchase amount exceeds 100 EUR. If so, it applies the appropriate discount based on the payment method. In this case, since the payment method is cash, a 5% discount is applied to the purchase amount of '120' EUR, resulting in a final price of '114' EUR. If the input cannot be converted to a floating-point number or if it does not represent a valid decimal number, the code catches the exception and prints an error message indicating that the input is invalid. In this case, since the input is a valid string representation of a decimal number, there are no errors or exceptions thrown by the code.
