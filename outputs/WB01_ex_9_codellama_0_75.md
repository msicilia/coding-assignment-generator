You are correct, here is an example code for the problem:
```
euros = 100
exchange_rate = 1.3
commission_percentage = 2

# Calculate the commission
commission = commission_percentage / 100 * (euros + euros * exchange_rate)

# Calculate the equivalent amount in pounds
pounds = euros + commission

print("The equivalent amount in pounds is:", pounds)
```
This code uses variables to represent the input values and calculates the commission and the equivalent amount in pounds. It does not use any Python elements such as functions.
