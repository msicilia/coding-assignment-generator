Here is an example of how you could approach this problem without using any functions:

```python
# Given Temperature in Fahrenheit
TF = 100  
TC = (TF - 32) * 5/9   
print("Given Temp in F : ", TF, " equivalent Temp in C is: ", TC)    

# Given Temperature in Celsius
TC = 37.8  
TF = (9.0*TC)/5.0 + 32.0      
print("Given Temp in C : ", TC, " equivalent Temp in F is: ", TF)   
```

This code will not use any functions for the conversion calculations and it does not read data from keyboard input, instead using hardcoded variables.
