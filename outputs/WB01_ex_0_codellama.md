  The task is to write Python code to calculate the area of a square using two variables: one to store the side length and one to store the area. The user has specified that they cannot use functions in their solution. Here's an example of how you could solve this problem:
```
# Initialize variables for side length and area
side_length = 5
area = side_length ** 2

# Print the result
print("The area of the square is", area)
```
This code uses the basic arithmetic operation to calculate the area of a square. The `**` operator is used to raise the value of side length to the power of two, which gives us the area of the square. Finally, the area is printed using the `print()` function.
