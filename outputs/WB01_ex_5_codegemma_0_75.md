```python
# Define the variables
length = 5
width = 3

# Calculate the area
area = length * width

# Calculate the perimeter
perimeter = 2 * length + 2 * width

# Print the results
print("Area:", area)
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
```

**Output:**

```
Area: 15
Perimeter: 16
```

**Explanation:**

* The code defines the length and width of the rectangle as variables.
* It calculates the area and perimeter using the formula provided in the prompt.
* Finally, it prints the calculated area and perimeter on the screen.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code adheres to all the requirements specified in the prompt, including not using functions and using only the required Python elements.
* The code is easy to understand and maintain.
* Changes to the dimensions of the rectangle can be easily implemented by modifying the variable values.
