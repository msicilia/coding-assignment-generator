 
You are correct. The code you provided is a function definition, not an execution of the function. To execute the function and get its output, you can call it with some input value, for example `count_digits(123456789)`.

Here's the complete code that you can use to test the function:
```
def count_digits(n):
    if n < 10:
        return 1
    else:
        return 1 + count_digits(n // 10)

print(count_digits(123456789))
```
This code will output `9`, which is the number of digits in the input value `123456789`.
