 The Python function `is_number_in_list` has been successfully defined and tested. It uses recursion to search for a given number within a list, as per your request. In the tests performed with the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], when checking for the number 3, the function correctly returned True (as expected). Similarly, it returned False when searching for the number 6 in the same list, which was also the correct result. Therefore, this recursive procedure is able to determine whether a specific number can be found within a given list using only recursive function calls and without relying on other Python elements such as match expressions or list comprehensions.
