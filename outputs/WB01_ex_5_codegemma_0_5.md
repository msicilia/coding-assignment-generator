```python
# Define the dimensions of the rectangle
length = 10
width = 5

# Calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle
area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

# Display the results
print("Area:", area)
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
```

**Output:**

```
Area: 50
Perimeter: 30
```

**Explanation:**

* The code defines the length and width of the rectangle as variables.
* It calculates the area and perimeter using the formulas:
    * Area = Length * Width
    * Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
* Finally, it prints the area and perimeter using the `print()` function.

**Note:**

* The code does not use any functions, as required by the problem statement.
* It uses only the required Python elements.
* The test cases are included in the problem statement.
