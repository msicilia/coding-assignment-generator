 Thought: I will define a variable to hold the side length of the square and another variable to hold the area. The formula for the area of a square is the side length squared (side_length * side_length). Then, I'll print out the result. This time, I'll make sure to include code with the correct pattern.

   Code:
```python
side_length = 5 # Replace with desired side length
area = side_length * side_length
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```
