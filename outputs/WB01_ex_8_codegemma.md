```python
# Sales amount in euros
total_sales = 15000

# Basic salary per month
basic_salary = 2000

# Commission rate
commission_rate = 0.03

# Income tax rate
tax_rate = 0.32

# Calculate commission
commission = total_sales * commission_rate

# Calculate total salary
total_salary = basic_salary + commission

# Calculate income tax
income_tax = total_salary * tax_rate

# Calculate net salary
net_salary = total_salary - income_tax

# Print net salary
print("Net salary:", net_salary)
