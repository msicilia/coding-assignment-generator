Based on your previous message, I assume that you are looking for a Python code that can calculate the area of a square with a single variable. Here is an example of how you can do this:
```python
# Calculate the area of a square using a single variable

# Initialize the side length of the square
side_length = 5

# Calculate the area of the square
area = side_length * side_length

# Print the result
print(f"The area of the square is {area}")
```
In this code, we first initialize the side length of the square to be 5. Then, we calculate the area of the square by multiplying the side length by itself. Finally, we print the result using the `print()` function and formatting it as a string with the `f` string prefix.

You mentioned that you cannot use functions in your code, so I have not used any functions in this example. However, you can still test this code to make sure it works by assigning a value to the `side_length` variable and running the code. For example:
```python
# Assign a value to the side length variable
side_length = 5

# Run the code
print(f"The area of the square is {side_length * side_length}")
```
This should print the result `The area of the square is 25`, which is the area of a square with side length 5.
