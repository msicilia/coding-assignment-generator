Thought: To solve this problem without using functions or input(), we need to directly calculate the tax payable based on the given annual income and number of sons. We will use basic arithmetic operations to compute the taxable income and then the tax payable.

Code:
```py
# Variables to store input values
annual_income = 50000  # Example value for annual income in euros
number_of_sons = 2    # Example value for number of sons

# Calculate taxable income
taxable_income = annual_income - 600 - (60 * number_of_sons)

# Calculate tax payable
tax_payable = taxable_income / 3

# Print the result
print("Tax payable:", tax_payable, "euros")
