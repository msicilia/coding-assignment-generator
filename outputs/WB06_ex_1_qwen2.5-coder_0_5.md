Thoughts: To solve this problem, I need to define a function that takes a dictionary and a list as input. The function should iterate through the list and check if each element exists as a key in the dictionary. If it does, the corresponding value from the dictionary should be added to one list; otherwise, it should be added to another list. This process should be repeated for all elements in the list.

Final Answer: Here is the corrected code snippet:

```py
def split_values_by_dict(dictionary, input_list):
    values_in_dict = []
    values_not_in_dict = []

    for item in input_list:
        if item in dictionary:
            values_in_dict.append(dictionary[item])
        else:
            values_not_in_dict.append(item)

    return values_in_dict, values_not_in_dict

# Example usage
dict_example = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
list_example = ['a', 'd', 'b', 'e']
result = split_values_by_dict(dict_example, list_example)
print("Values in dict:", result[0])
print("Values not in dict:", result[1])
```

This code defines a function `split_values_by_dict` that takes a dictionary and a list as input. It initializes two empty lists: one for values in the dictionary and another for values not in the dictionary. The function then iterates through each item in the input list, checks if it exists as a key in the dictionary, and appends the corresponding value or the item itself to the appropriate list. Finally, it returns both lists.

The example usage demonstrates how to call the `split_values_by_dict` function with a sample dictionary and list, and prints the results.
