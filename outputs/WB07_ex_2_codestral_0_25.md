 The problem is about creating a recursive function in Python that takes an integer as input and returns the count of its digits. To solve this problem, we can define a function `count_digits` that checks if the absolute value of the given number is less than 10. If it is, then the function should return 1 (since there's only one digit). Otherwise, the function should recursively call itself with the integer division of the number by 10 and add 1 to the result.

   Here's a solution that follows these steps:

```python
def count_digits(n):
    if abs(n) < 10:
        return 1
    else:
        return 1 + count_digits(n // 10)
```

   To test the function, we can use some example test cases:

```python
print(count_digits(0))         # Expected output: 1
print(count_digits(123456789))  # Expected output: 9
print(count_digits(-987654321)) # Expected output: 9
```
