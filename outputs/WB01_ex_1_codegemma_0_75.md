**Code:**

```python
# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 5

# Calculate the area of the square
area = side_length * side_length

# Print the area of the square
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code defines a variable `side_length` with a value of 5.
* It calculates the area of the square by multiplying `side_length` by itself.
* Finally, it prints the area of the square using the `print()` function.

**Test Cases:**

* The code correctly calculates and displays the area of a square with a side length of 5.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code does not use any functions.
* The code only uses variables.
* The code does not use the `input()` function.

**Conclusion:**

The provided code successfully solves the problem of displaying the area of a square using a single variable, adhering to the given constraints.
