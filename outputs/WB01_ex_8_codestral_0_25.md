 Thoughts: Given that we cannot use functions and need to calculate the net salary using variables only, I will first declare three variables: one for the basic salary, one for the total sales made in the last month, and one for the commission earned from these sales. Then, I will calculate the gross salary by adding the commission to the basic salary. After that, I will calculate the income tax based on 32% of the gross salary. Finally, I will determine the net salary by subtracting the income tax from the gross salary and print out this value.

   Code:
```py
# Declare variables
basic_salary = 2000
total_sales = 15000 # assuming total sales to be 15000 euros for last month

# Calculate commission
commission = total_sales * 0.03

# Calculate gross salary
gross_salary = basic_salary + commission

# Calculate income tax
income_tax = gross_salary * 0.32

# Calculate net salary
net_salary = gross_salary - income_tax

# Print the result
print("The net salary for this month is:", round(net_salary, 2), "euros")
```
