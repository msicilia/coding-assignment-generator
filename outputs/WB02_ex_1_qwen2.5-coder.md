Thoughts: I will provide a solution using only basic data types, functions, and avoid loops and conditional statements as per the given requirements.

Final Answer:
```python
def m2_to_barn(m2):
    return m2 / 1e-28

def barn_to_m2(barn):
    return barn * 1e-28

# Example test cases
print(m2_to_barn(1)) # Expected output: 1e+28
print(barn_to_m2(1e+28)) # Expected output: 1.0
```
In this solution, we have two functions: `m2_to_barn` and `barn_to_m2`. The `m2_to_barn` function takes a value in square meters (mÂ²) as input and returns the equivalent value in Barns by dividing it by 1e-28. Similarly, the `barn_to_m2` function takes a value in Barns as input and returns the equivalent value in square meters by multiplying it by 1e-28.

These functions follow good practices of modularity and information hiding, as they are self-contained and only perform the necessary conversions without any additional logic.
