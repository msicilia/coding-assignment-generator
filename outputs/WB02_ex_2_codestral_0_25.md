 The provided Python code successfully defines a function called `calculate_AER` that calculates the Annual Effective Interest Rate (AER) based on the annual nominal rate (ANN) and the number of compounding periods (m). This meets all the requirements mentioned, as it uses functions and does not include data structures, loops, or conditional statements. The code is also well-structured, with the function definition and usage clearly separated for better modularity and information hiding.

   Additionally, the code includes some test cases to verify that the function works correctly. These tests use different values of ANN and m, demonstrating the function's ability to handle various scenarios. Overall, this solution is clear, concise, and effective at calculating the AER according to the given formula without using unnecessary Python elements.
