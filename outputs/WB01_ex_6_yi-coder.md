Here is a Python program that solves your problem:

```python
# Initializing real numbers
x = 3.2
y = 4.5
z = 6.7

# Calculating sum total and product total
sum_total = x + y + z
product_total = x * y * z

# Calculating mean
mean = sum_total / 3

# Displaying data on the screen
print("Sum Total: ", sum_total)
print("Product Total: ", product_total)
print("Mean: ", mean)

# Initializing integer variables
i = int(x)
j = int(y)
k = int(z)
l = i + j + k
m = i * j* k
n = l / 3

# Displaying data on the screen for integer variables
print("Sum Total (Integer Variables): ", l)
print("Product Total (Integer Variables): ", m)
print("Mean (Integer Variables): ", n)
```

This program first initializes 3 real numbers and calculates their sum total and product total. It then calculates the mean of these numbers. Finally it uses integer variables based on the real number values and performs similar operations to demonstrate how they work.
