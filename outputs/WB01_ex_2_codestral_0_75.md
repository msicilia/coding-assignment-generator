 The provided Python code correctly calculates the tax payable by a taxpayer based on their annual income and number of sons, following the given rules.

   In this solution:

   1. Variables are used to store the annual income (`annual_income`) and the number of sons (`number_of_sons`).
   2. The taxable income is calculated by subtracting a personal deduction of €600 and an additional deduction of €60 per son from the total income. This result is stored in the variable `taxable_income`.
   3. Finally, the tax payable is calculated as one third of the taxable income. The result is stored in the variable `tax_payable`.
   4. Lastly, the program prints out a statement displaying the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer. Based on the given values (annual income = €120000 and number of sons = 3), the calculated tax payable is €39740.

   This solution meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, including not using input functions or Python functions, and only using variables to solve the problem.
