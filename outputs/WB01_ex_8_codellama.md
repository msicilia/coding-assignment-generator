```py
total_sales = 1000 # Replace with actual sales amount
basic_salary = 2000
commission = total_sales * 0.03
income_tax = commission * 0.32
net_salary = basic_salary + commission - income_tax
print(f"The net salary is {net_salary} euros.")
```
This program calculates the total sales, adds 3% commission to it, then subtracts 32% income tax from the total. Finally, it prints out the net salary received by the salesperson. Note that this program uses only basic Python syntax and does not use any functions or other advanced elements of the language.
