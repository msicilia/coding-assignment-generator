Thoughts:

To solve this problem, we need to implement a class `Point` that represents a point in 2D space with x and y coordinates. We will use dictionaries to store the coordinates.

We also need to define two static methods in the `Point` class: `perform_addition` and `perform_subtraction`. These methods will take two instances of `Point` as arguments and return a new instance representing the result of the addition or subtraction.

Here's the implementation:

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.coordinates = {'x': x, 'y': y}

    @staticmethod
    def perform_addition(point1, point2):
        result_x = point1.coordinates['x'] + point2.coordinates['x']
        result_y = point1.coordinates['y'] + point2.coordinates['y']
        return Point(result_x, result_y)

    @staticmethod
    def perform_subtraction(point1, point2):
        result_x = point1.coordinates['x'] - point2.coordinates['x']
        result_y = point1.coordinates['y'] - point2.coordinates['y']
        return Point(result_x, result_y)


# Example test cases

# Creating points
point1 = Point(3, 5)
point2 = Point(1, 7)

# Adding points
result_add = Point.perform_addition(point1, point2)
print("Point addition:", result_add.coordinates)  # Output: {'x': 4, 'y': 12}

# Subtracting points
result_subtract = Point.perform_subtraction(point1, point2)
print("Point subtraction:", result_subtract.coordinates)  # Output: {'x': 2, 'y': -2}
```

This solution uses dictionaries to store the coordinates of a point and defines two static methods for addition and subtraction. The example test cases demonstrate how to create points and perform operations on them.

The code meets the requirements by not using match expressions or list comprehensions and instead relies on simple dictionary operations.
