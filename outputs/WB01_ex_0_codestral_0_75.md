 ```python
   # Assigning the value of side length
   side_length = 5

   # Calculating the area by squaring the side length
   area = side_length ** 2

   # Printing the result
   print('The area of the square is:', area)
   ```

In this code, we first assign the value of the side length to the variable `side_length`. Then, we calculate the area by squaring the side length and store it in the variable `area`. Finally, we use Python's print function to display the calculated area.
