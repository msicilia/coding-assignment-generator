  The answer is as follows:
```py
side_length = 5
area = side_length ** 2
print(f"The area of the square is {area}")
```
In this code, we first define two variables: `side_length` and `area`. We then set the value of `side_length` to 5 using an assignment operator (`=`). Next, we calculate the area of a square with side length of 5 using the formula for the area of a square, which is `side_length ** 2`, and store it in `area`. Finally, we print out the message "The area of the square is" followed by the value stored in `area`.

Note that this code uses no built-in Python functions, as required by the problem.Calling tools:
