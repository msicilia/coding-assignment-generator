def count_digits(n):
    if n < 10:
        return 1
    else:
        return count_digits(n // 10) + 1
```
This is a recursive function that takes an integer as input and counts the number of digits in it. It uses the `//` operator to divide the input by 10, which is equivalent to performing a floor division operation. The function then returns the result of adding 1 to the number of digits in the remainder of the division.

Here are some example test cases for this function:
```
print(count_digits(123)) # Output: 3
print(count_digits(1234)) # Output: 4
print(count_digits(123456789)) # Output: 9
```
The output from the tool for each input will be displayed in the `Observation` section of the task.
