To solve this problem, you can use variables to represent the distance traveled, the liters of diesel used, the cost per liter of diesel, and the other costs of maintaining the truck. You can then calculate the kilometers traveled per liter by dividing the distance traveled by the number of liters of diesel used. The total cost of the trip can be calculated by multiplying the distance traveled by the cost per liter of diesel, and adding the other costs of maintaining the truck. Finally, you can calculate the total cost per kilometer by dividing the total cost of the trip by the distance traveled.

Here is an example of how you can do this:
```
# Define variables to represent the distance traveled, the liters of diesel used, the cost per liter of diesel, and the other costs of maintaining the truck
distance = 500
liters = 10
cost_per_liter = 2.5
other_costs = 50

# Calculate the kilometers traveled per liter by dividing the distance traveled by the number of liters of diesel used
kilometers_traveled_per_liter = distance / liters

# Calculate the total cost of the trip by multiplying the distance traveled by the cost per liter of diesel, and adding the other costs of maintaining the truck
total_cost = kilometers_traveled_per_liter * cost_per_liter + other_costs

# Calculate the total cost per kilometer by dividing the total cost of the trip by the distance traveled
total_cost_per_kilometer = total_cost / distance

print("The kilometers traveled per liter is", kilometers_traveled_per_liter)
print("The total cost of the trip is", total_cost)
print("The total cost per kilometer is", total_cost_per_kilometer)
```
This code will output the following:
```
The kilometers traveled per liter is 0.5
The total cost of the trip is 125
The total cost per kilometer is 25
```
Note that this code does not use any functions, but it does use variables to represent the different values and perform calculations with them.
