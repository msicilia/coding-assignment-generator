```python
# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 7

# Calculate the area of the square
area = side_length ** 2

# Print the area of the square
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```

**Output:**
```
The area of the square is: 49
```

**Explanation:**

* The code defines a variable `side_length` with a value of 7.
* It calculates the area of the square by squaring the `side_length` using the exponentiation operator `**`.
* Finally, it prints the area of the square using the `print()` function.

**Note:**

* The code does not use any functions.
* The variables and operations are performed within the single code snippet.
* The `input()` function is not used to read data from the keyboard.
