You are correct, the previous error was caused by an invalid pattern in the code snippet. To fix this issue, make sure that your code snippet includes the correct pattern for Python code, such as:
```
Thoughts: Your thoughts
Code:
```py
# Your python code here
```
The code should be written in a single block of code without any indentation or line breaks. Also, make sure to include the `#` symbol at the beginning of each line to indicate that it is a comment.

Here is an example of how the code might look like:
```py
# Your python code here
width = 5
area = width * width
print(f"The area of the square is {area}")
```
This code calculates the area of a square with a side length of 5 units and prints it to the console. It uses a single variable `width` to store the side length of the square, and then calculates the area using the formula for the area of a square (`area = width * width`). Finally, it prints the calculated area to the console using a formatted string with the value of `area`.

In general, it's important to test your code with a variety of inputs and edge cases to ensure that it works correctly. You can also use tools like `assert` or `unittest` to write tests that check the output of your code against expected values.
