 Thought: I will define a Python function called 'force' that takes two arguments, 'mass' and 'acceleration', and returns their product as the formula for calculating force is mass times acceleration (F = ma). Then I will create test cases to demonstrate this function's functionality.

   Code:
   ```python
   def force(mass, acceleration):
       return mass * acceleration

   # Test cases
   print("Force when mass is 5 kg and acceleration is 10 m/s^2:", force(5, 10))
   print("Force when mass is 3 kg and acceleration is 7 m/s^2:", force(3, 7))
   print("Force when mass is 9 kg and acceleration is 2 m/s^2:", force(9, 2))
   ```
