Thought: The code snippet provided successfully calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using the given side lengths and prints the results. No additional steps are needed as the requirements have been met.

Final Code:
```python
# Assign values to the sides of the rectangle
length = 5
width = 3

# Calculate the area
area = length * width

# Calculate the perimeter
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

# Display the area and perimeter on the screen
print("Area:", area)
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
```

This code meets all the specified requirements, including the use of variables, calculations for area and perimeter, and printing the results.
