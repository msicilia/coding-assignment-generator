Here is an example where I create a variable for side length and then calculate the area directly:
```py
# Declare the single variable (side length) for the square
side_length = 5

# Calculate the area of the square using the formula for a square - side_length * side_length
area = side_length ** 2  # The symbol '**' is used to raise a number to a power in Python.

# Display the calculated area
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```
In this code, we are not using any function, and directly calculate the area using the side length of the square. The symbol '**' is used for exponentiation in Python, which we use to raise 'side_length' to the power 2 (since the area of a square is calculated as side^2).
This code should work fine if you are not allowed to use functions or operations. However, please make sure that your programming environment doesn't have any restrictions about built-in Python functionalities and operators which would prevent this solution from working properly.
