```python
# Define the dimensions of the rectangle
length = 10
width = 5

# Calculate the area of the rectangle
area = length * width

# Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

# Display the results
print("Area:", area)
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
```

**Output:**

```
Area: 50
Perimeter: 30
```

**Explanation:**

* The code follows the specified requirements and uses variables to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
* There are no functions used, as per the user's request.
* The output matches the expected results.
