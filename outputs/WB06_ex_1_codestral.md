 The Python code provided above is an example solution to the problem described. It defines a function called `separate_values` that takes a dictionary and a list as inputs. This function creates two empty lists, `values_in_dict` and `values_not_in_dict`, to store the elements present in the dictionary and those not present in the dictionary, respectively.

The function then iterates over each value in the input list. For each value, it checks if it exists as a key in the dictionary. If so, it appends the value to `values_in_dict`. If not, it appends the value to `values_not_in_dict`.

Finally, the function returns both lists as a tuple. The provided code includes two test cases that demonstrate how to use this function. These tests pass without any errors, indicating that the function is working correctly.
