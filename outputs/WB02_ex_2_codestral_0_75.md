 The user task requires writing a Python function that calculates the Annual Effective Interest Rate (AER) given the annual nominal rate (ANN) and the number of compounding periods in a year (m). The solution should use functions, avoid data structures, loops, and conditional statements. Here's how you can approach this problem:

```python
def calculate_aer(ann, m):
    return ((1 + ann/m) ** m) - 1

# Test cases
print(calculate_aer(0.05, 12))  # ANN = 5%, m = 12 (monthly compounding)
print(calculate_aer(0.06, 4))   # ANN = 6%, m = 4 (quarterly compounding)
print(calculate_aer(0.07, 2))   # ANN = 7%, m = 2 (semiannual compounding)
```

In this solution, we define a function `calculate_aer` that takes two arguments: the annual nominal rate (ANN) and the number of compounding periods in a year (m). The function returns the calculated Annual Effective Interest Rate (AER) based on the given formula. We then provide some example test cases to demonstrate the usage of the `calculate_aer` function.
