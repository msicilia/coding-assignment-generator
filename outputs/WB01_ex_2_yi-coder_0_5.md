Here's an example solution:

```python
# defining variables
annual_income = 12000  # replace with real data
number_of_sons = 3    # replace with real data

# calculations
taxable_income = annual_income - 600 - (60 * number_of_sons)
tax_payable = taxable_income / 3.0

print("The tax payable is: ", tax_payable)
```
Remember to replace 'annual_income' and 'number_of_sons' with the real data of the taxpayer. The solution doesn't use any Python functions as per your requirements.
