```python
# Define the side length
side_length = 5

# Calculate the area
area = side_length * side_length

# Display the area
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```

**Output:**

```
The area of the square is: 25
```

**Explanation:**

* The code correctly calculates the area of a square using the formula `area = side_length * side_length`.
* There is no need for the `**` operator as it is not supported in this task.
* The code correctly displays the area of the square.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code does not use any functions, as per the task requirements.
* The code uses variables to store the side length and area.
* The code does not use `input()` to read data from the keyboard.
