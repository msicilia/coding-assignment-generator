 The Python code provided above defines a `Point` class that supports 2D points with x and y coordinates. It includes methods for adding and subtracting points using dictionaries to store the coordinates. The example test cases demonstrate how to create and manipulate points using these functions.

   To solve this problem, I defined a `Point` class with an initializer that takes in optional x and y coordinates (defaulting to 0) and stores them as a dictionary. I then implemented two methods for the class: `__add__`, which adds the x and y coordinates of two points separately, and `__sub__`, which subtracts the coordinates of one point from another.

   The example test cases show how to create two instances of the `Point` class with specific coordinates, add them together using the `+` operator, and then subtract one point from the other using the `-` operator. The results are printed out for each operation.
