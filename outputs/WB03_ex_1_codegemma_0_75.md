**Explanation:**

* The `convert_time()` function takes a time in 24-hour notation as an argument.
* It splits the time into hours and minutes using the `split()` method.
* It converts the hours to 12-hour notation using a conditional statement.
* It returns the time in 12-hour notation as a string.

**Test Cases:**

* The function is tested with the values `12:34` and `06:30`.
* The output of these tests is `12:34 PM` and `6:30 AM`, respectively.

**Validation:**

* The function does not perform any validation on the input time.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code does not use any data structures, loops, or match expressions.
* The `input()` function is not used to read data from the keyboard.
* The code uses variables to test the function.
