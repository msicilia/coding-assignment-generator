Thought: To solve this problem, we need to initialize three real numbers and then calculate their mean, sum total, and product total. We will use variables `x`, `y`, and `z` to store the real numbers. Then, we will calculate the sum, mean, and product using these variables.

1. Initialize the real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z`.
2. Calculate the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z`.
3. Calculate the mean by dividing the sum by 3.
4. Calculate the product of `x`, `y`, and `z`.
5. Display all these data on the screen.

Code:
```py
# Initialize the real numbers
x = 1.0
y = 2.0
z = 3.0

# Calculate the sum
sum_total = x + y + z

# Calculate the mean
mean = sum_total / 3

# Calculate the product
product_total = x * y * z

# Display all these data on the screen
print("Sum Total:", sum_total)
print("Mean:", mean)
print("Product Total:", product_total)
```
