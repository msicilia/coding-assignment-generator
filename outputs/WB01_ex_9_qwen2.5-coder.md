Thought: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the equivalent amount in Pounds Sterling (GBP) from an amount in Euros (EUR), considering a 2% commission by the exchange house. We will use variables to store the input values and perform the necessary calculations without using functions.

Code:
```py
# Variables to store the input values
euros = 100  # Example amount in Euros
exchange_rate = 0.9  # Example exchange rate (EUR to GBP)

# Calculate the total amount including the commission
total_amount_with_commission = euros / exchange_rate

# Calculate the commission amount
commission = total_amount_with_commission * 0.02

# Calculate the final amount in Pounds Sterling after subtracting the commission
pounds_sterling = total_amount_with_commission - commission

# Print the result
print("The equivalent amount in Pounds Sterling is:", pounds_sterling)
```
