 
You are correct, my previous response was incorrect. I apologize for any confusion caused. Here is the corrected response:

Based on the information provided, it appears that the user is trying to write a Python program that calculates and displays the area of a square using a single variable. The code should not use any functions or external libraries, but should be able to accept input from the user and display the result.

To solve this problem, the user can use the following steps:

1. Define a variable `side` to store the length of one side of the square.
2. Use the formula for the area of a square (A = s^2, where s is the length of one side) to calculate the area of the square.
3. Print the result using a format string.

Here is an example code snippet that satisfies all the requirements:
```py
# Define a variable 'side' to store the length of one side of the square
side = float(input("Enter the length of one side of the square: "))

# Calculate the area of the square using the formula A = s^2
area = side * side

# Print the result
print(f"The area of the square is {area}")
```
I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
