Here's how you could solve this problem:

```python
# define the variable for side length
side_length = 5

# calculate the area (without using a function)
area = side_length * side_length

print("The area of the square is:", area)
```
In this code snippet:
1. We're defining `side_length` as 5 and then calculating the area by multiplying it with itself (`side_length * side_length`).
2. We then print out the result to display the area of the square.
