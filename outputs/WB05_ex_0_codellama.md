  You are correct, I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The error message "Code parsing failed on line 3 due to: SyntaxError" indicates that there is a syntax error in your code on line 3.

To fix this issue, you can try using a Python linter tool such as flake8 or pylint to check for syntax errors in your code before submitting it. You can also try running the code in a Python interpreter to see if there are any errors that it reports.

Additionally, you may want to consider rewriting your code using a different approach, such as using a loop to iterate over the elements of both lists and adding them element by element. This way, you can avoid using any syntax errors or invalid statements in your code.
