The provided code has successfully generated a version 1 QR code (a 21x21 pixel square) with random black and white pixels, represented by asterisks (*) and spaces (' '), respectively. This was done by creating an empty dictionary to represent the QR code, then iterating over each pixel in the square and assigning it a random value of either '*' or ' '. Finally, the code printed out the QR code to the console using nested loops to iterate over each row and column of the dictionary.

To address the requirement to use dictionaries instead of list comprehensions, I used a dictionary to store the pixels of the QR code. This allowed me to easily access and modify the value of each pixel in the square using its x-y coordinates as the key. Using a 2D array (i.e., a list of lists) would have been more straightforward, but dictionaries were required for this task.

The code could be further improved by adding error checking to ensure that the size of the QR code is within the valid range of 21x21 to 177x177 pixels, and by allowing the user to specify the size of the QR code as a command-line argument instead of hardcoding it into the program. Additionally, the use of the randint function from the random library was not necessary for this task, as a simple comparison between a random float value and 0.5 would have sufficed to generate random black or white pixels. However, these improvements were not required for this task.
