Thought: The previous approach worked correctly and displayed the area of the square without using any external libraries. Let's summarize the solution and provide an example test case.

Code:
```py
# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 5

# Calculate the area using a single variable
area = side_length * side_length

# Display the area
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```

Final Answer:
```python
# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 5

# Calculate the area using a single variable
area = side_length * side_length

# Display the area
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```

Example Test Case:
```python
# Set the side length to 10
side_length = 10

# Calculate the area
area = side_length * side_length

# Expected output: The area of the square is: 100
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```

This code correctly calculates and displays the area of a square using a single variable, adhering to all the given constraints.
