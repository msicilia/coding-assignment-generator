Here is the Python code to solve the problem without using functions:

```python
# Define the variables
basic_salary = 2000
commission_rate = 0.03
income_tax_rate = 0.32

# Example sales amount for testing
sales_amount = 5000

# Calculate the commission
commission = sales_amount * commission_rate

# Calculate the total amount before tax
total_before_tax = basic_salary + commission

# Calculate the income tax
income_tax = total_before_tax * income_tax_rate

# Calculate the net salary
net_salary = total_before_tax - income_tax

# Print the net salary
print("The net salary of the salesperson is:", net_salary, "euros")
```

This code will output:
```
The net salary of the salesperson is: 1462.0 euros
```
