Thoughts:

The problem requires calculating the total seconds elapsed since the last midnight and the seconds remaining until the next midnight based on a given time. We can achieve this using basic arithmetic operations without relying on any Python functions or built-in methods.

Here's how we can break down the problem:
1. Convert the given time (hours, minutes, and seconds) into total seconds elapsed since midnight.
2. Calculate the remaining seconds until the next midnight by subtracting the total seconds elapsed from 86400 (the number of seconds in a day).

Let's write the code to implement this logic:

### Code:
```py
# Given time in hours, minutes, and seconds
hours = 24
minutes = 0
seconds = 1

# Calculate total seconds elapsed since midnight
total_seconds_elapsed = hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds

# Calculate remaining seconds until the next midnight
remaining_seconds_until_midnight = 86400 - total_seconds_elapsed

# Display the results
print("Total seconds elapsed since the last midnight:", total_seconds_elapsed)
print("Seconds remaining until the next midnight:", remaining_seconds_until_midnight)
```

### Explanation:
- `total_seconds_elapsed` is calculated by converting hours to seconds (`hours * 3600`) and adding the converted minutes to it (`minutes * 60`). Finally, we add the given seconds.
- `remaining_seconds_until_midnight` is calculated by subtracting the `total_seconds_elapsed` from 86400 (the total number of seconds in a day).

This code will correctly display the total seconds elapsed since the last midnight and the seconds remaining until the next midnight for any valid time input.
