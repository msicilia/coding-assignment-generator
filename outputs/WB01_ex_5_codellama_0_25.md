To solve this problem, you can use the following steps:

1. Define the lengths of the two sides of the rectangle using variables.
2. Calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying the lengths of the sides.
3. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle by adding the lengths of the sides together and multiplying by 2.
4. Display the results on the screen using print statements.

Here is an example code that solves this problem:
```
length1 = 5
length2 = 6

area = length1 * length2
perimeter = 2 * (length1 + length2)

print("The area of the rectangle is", area, "square units.")
print("The perimeter of the rectangle is", perimeter, "units.")
```
This code will calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle with sides of lengths 5 and 6 and display them on the screen.

Note that this solution does not use any built-in Python functions to read data from the keyboard or perform calculations, so it meets the requirements of not using input() to read data from the keyboard and does not require any additional libraries or modules to be imported.
