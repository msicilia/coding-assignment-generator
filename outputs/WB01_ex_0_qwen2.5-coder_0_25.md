Here is the Python code that solves the problem:

```py
# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 5

# Calculate the area of the square
area = side_length ** 2

# Display the area of the square
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```

### Example Test Cases:
1. If `side_length` is set to 7, the output should be:
   ```
   The area of the square is: 49
   ```

2. If `side_length` is set to 3, the output should be:
   ```
   The area of the square is: 9
   ```

This code demonstrates how to store the side length and calculate the area of a square using two variables without using any functions or input calls.
