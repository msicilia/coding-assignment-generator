 The code provided above successfully generates a table with the first 'n' powers of 2, 3, and 5, where 'n' is a positive integer. However, since the task mentioned that we cannot use data structures except basic iterations of sequences in loops, there seems to be a misunderstanding as the given solution uses data structures such as lists and for loops to generate the table.

To meet the requirements of not using data structures other than basic iterations, I will modify the code by using nested loops and print statements instead. Here's how it can be done:

```python
n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))

print("\tPowers of 2\tPowers of 3\tPowers of 5")

# Loop through each power from 0 to n-1
for i in range(n):
    # Calculate the powers and print them side by side
    print("Power", i, "\t", 2**i, "\t\t", 3**i, "\t\t", 5**i)
```

This code will prompt the user to enter a positive integer 'n'. It then prints a header for the table. After that, it uses a loop to calculate and print the powers of 2, 3, and 5 for each power from 0 to n-1. This meets all the requirements mentioned in the task without using any data structures except basic iterations.
