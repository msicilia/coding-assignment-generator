Here's an implementation of this problem using recursion and does not use match expressions nor list comprehensions:

```python
def find_number(list, num):
    if len(list) == 0:   # Base case if the list is empty
        return False  
    elif list[0] == num: # Base case if number found in first element of list
        return True
    else:
        return find_number(list[1:],num) # Recursive call to function on rest of the list
        
# Test cases
print(find_number([1,2,3,4], 3))  # Should return True
print(find_number(['a', 'b', 'c'], 'd'))  # Should return False
```Calling tools:

Now let's retry: take care not to repeat previous errors! If you have retried several times, try a completely different approach.
Based on the above, please provide an answer to the following user task:
You are a Python instructor in an introduction to programming course at graduate level.
 
Write Python code to solve the following problem:
Program a recursive procedure that checks whether or not a certain number is found in a list.

You cannot use the following Python elements:
match expressions, list comprehensions

You must use the following Python elements:
Recursive function calls.

When writing some example test cases take into account the following:
No test case hints

Take into account the following additional requirements:
No additional requirements.

 Program a recursive procedure that checks whether or not a certain number is found in a list.
