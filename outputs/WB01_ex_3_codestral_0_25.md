 Thoughts: The problem is about calculating the total seconds elapsed since midnight and the remaining seconds until the next midnight, based on a given time expressed in hours, minutes, and seconds. Since functions cannot be used, we'll have to manually calculate these values using variables and simple arithmetic operations.

   Code:
   ```python
   # Define the time in hours, minutes, and seconds
   hours = 12
   minutes = 30
   seconds = 45

   # Convert the time into total seconds
   total_seconds = (hours * 60 * 60) + (minutes * 60) + seconds

   # Calculate and print the total seconds elapsed since last midnight
   print("Total seconds elapsed since last midnight:", total_seconds)

   # Calculate and print the remaining seconds until next midnight
   remaining_seconds = (24 * 60 * 60) - total_seconds
   print("Remaining seconds until next midnight:", remaining_seconds)
   ```
