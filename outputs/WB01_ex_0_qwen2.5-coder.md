Certainly! Below is the Python code that meets all the specified requirements:

```python
# Variables to store the side length and area of the square
side_length = 5
area = side_length ** 2

# Display the area of the square
print("The area of the square is:", area)

# Test cases
side_length_test1 = 3
area_test1 = side_length_test1 ** 2
print("Test case 1 - Side Length:", side_length_test1, "Area:", area_test1)

side_length_test2 = 10
area_test2 = side_length_test2 ** 2
print("Test case 2 - Side Length:", side_length_test2, "Area:", area_test2)

side_length_test3 = 0
area_test3 = side_length_test3 ** 2
print("Test case 3 - Side Length:", side_length_test3, "Area:", area_test3)
```

This code defines the required variables and calculates the area of a square. It then prints the results using the `print` function. The test cases demonstrate that the code works correctly for different side lengths, including edge cases like a side length of 0.
