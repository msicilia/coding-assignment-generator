 Thought: I will write a Python program that uses loops to generate a table with the n first powers of 2, 3, and 5. Since we are unable to use input() in this environment, I'll set a fixed value for n (e.g., n=5) and present the results directly in the code output.

   Code:
```python
n = 5
print("Powers of 2, 3, and 5:")
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print(f"2^{i} = {2 ** i}, 3^{i} = {3 ** i}, 5^{i} = {5 ** i}")
```

   Output:
```
Powers of 2, 3, and 5:
2^1 = 2, 3^1 = 3, 5^1 = 5
2^2 = 4, 3^2 = 9, 5^2 = 25
2^3 = 8, 3^3 = 27, 5^3 = 125
2^4 = 16, 3^4 = 81, 5^4 = 625
2^5 = 32, 3^5 = 243, 5^5 = 3125
```
