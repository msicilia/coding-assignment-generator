You are correct, my previous response was incorrect. I apologize for any confusion caused. Here is the revised version of the answer:

Implement a 'force' function that returns the value of the physical quantity force from the mass and acceleration values received as parameters. Then build a tester program by specifying the necessary test cases that displays the value of the force to from a given mass and acceleration.

You can do this by creating a function called `force` that takes two arguments, `mass1` and `acceleration1`, and returns their product. You can then use this function in a separate tester program to test different scenarios and see the results. For example:
```
def force(mass1, acceleration1):
    return mass1 * acceleration1

print(force(5, 3)) # Should print 15
print(force(10, 6)) # Should print 60
print(force(1, 5)) # Should print 5
```
This code creates a function called `force` that takes two arguments, `mass1` and `acceleration1`, and returns their product. It then uses this function in a separate tester program to test different scenarios and see the results. The output for each scenario should be printed to the console.

You can also use conditional statements to check if the input values are valid before calculating the force. For example:
```
def force(mass1, acceleration1):
    if mass1 > 0 and acceleration1 > 0:
        return mass1 * acceleration1
    else:
        return None

print(force(5, 3)) # Should print 15
print(force(10, 6)) # Should print 60
print(force(-1, 5)) # Should print None
```
This code checks if the input values `mass1` and `acceleration1` are both positive before calculating the force. If either of them is negative or zero, the function returns `None`. This way you can handle invalid input values and avoid errors.
