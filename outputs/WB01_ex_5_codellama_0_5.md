  The user is asked to write Python code to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle based on the lengths of its sides. The user must use variables instead of calling input() to read data from the keyboard, and they cannot use functions. Here's an example solution:
```
# Calculate the area of the rectangle
side_1 = 5
side_2 = 3
area = side_1 * side_2
print("Area:", area)

# Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle
perimeter = 2 * (side_1 + side_2)
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
```
This code calculates the area and perimeter using basic arithmetic operations, rather than trying to assign a value to a variable within a function call. By using this approach, the user can avoid any potential errors related to assignment statements within function calls.

To provide additional support, I would suggest that the user try debugging their code by adding print statements to the code to check if the variables are being assigned correctly and if the calculation is correct. Additionally, the user can try breaking down the code into smaller functions to make it easier to understand and debug.
