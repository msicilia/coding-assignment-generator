```python
def m2_to_barn(m2):
    """Converts units in m² to Barns."""
    return m2 * 1e28

def barn_to_m2(barn):
    """Converts units in Barns to m²."""
    return barn / 1e28
```

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Convert 1 m² to Barns
barns = m2_to_barn(1)
print(barns)  # Output: 1e28

# Convert 1 Barn to m²
m2 = barn_to_m2(1e28)
print(m2)  # Output: 1.0
```

**Explanation:**

* The code defines two functions, `m2_to_barn()` and `barn_to_m2()`.
* `m2_to_barn()` multiplies the input value (in m²) by 1e28 to convert it to barns.
* `barn_to_m2()` divides the input value (in barns) by 1e28 to convert it to m².
* The example usage shows how to call the functions with sample values and print the results.

**Benefits of the Solution:**

* Follows good practices of modularity, including information hiding and the use of functions.
* Converts units accurately and efficiently.
* Provides clear documentation through comments.
* Includes example usage to demonstrate how to use the functions.
