Here's an example solution without defining any functions or using a function:

```python
# side length of the square
side = 5

# compute the area
area = side * side

print("The area of the square is:", area)
```
You can see that you can use variables to store and manipulate data in Python. The area of a square is just the side length multiplied by itself, so we set `area = side * side` to calculate this value. Finally, print() is used to display the result. 
In the test case scenario there are no requirements for specific values or function calls. Therefore, the solution does not need to be updated based on test cases.
