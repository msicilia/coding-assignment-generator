**Improved Code:**

```python
def find_number(num, lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    if lst[0] == num:
        return True
    return find_number(num, lst[1:])
```

**Changes Made:**

* The code has been simplified by removing unnecessary parentheses around the return statements.
* The code is now more readable and easier to understand.

**Example Test Cases:**

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(find_number(3, list1))  # Output: True
print(find_number(7, list1))  # Output: False
```

**Feedback:**

The code is correct and meets the requirements. It is well-written and easy to understand.

**Additional Improvements:**

* You could add a comment to the function to describe what it does.
* You could add unit tests to the code to ensure that it works as expected.
