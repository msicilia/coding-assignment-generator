Thought: To solve this problem, we need to create two variables: one to store the side length of the square and another to store its area. We will then calculate the area by squaring the side length and display it.

Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. Define a variable `side_length` and assign it a value.
2. Calculate the area by squaring the `side_length` and store it in the variable `area`.
3. Display the area using the `print()` function.

Code:
```py
# Step 1: Define the side length of the square
side_length = 5

# Step 2: Calculate the area of the square
area = side_length ** 2

# Step 3: Display the area
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```

This code will display the area of a square with a side length of 5.
