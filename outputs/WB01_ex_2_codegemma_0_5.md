```python
# Define the annual income and number of sons
annual_income = 180000
num_sons = 3

# Calculate the taxable income
taxable_income = annual_income - 600 - (60 * num_sons)

# Calculate the tax payable
tax_payable = taxable_income / 3

# Print the tax payable
print("Tax payable:", tax_payable)
