```python
# Define side length variable
side_length = 5

# Calculate area
area = side_length ** 2

# Display area
print("The area of the square is:", area)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code calculates the area by raising `side_length` to the power of 2 using the `**` operator.
* This is a valid syntax in Python and does not raise a syntax error.
* The area is calculated and displayed within the same code block.

**Output:**

```
The area of the square is: 25
```

**Note:**

* The code does not use any functions.
* The area is calculated and displayed within the same code block.
