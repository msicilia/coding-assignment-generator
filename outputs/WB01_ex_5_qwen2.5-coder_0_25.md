Here is the Python code that solves the problem as per the given requirements:

```py
# Define the length and width of the rectangle
length = 5
width = 3

# Calculate the area of the rectangle
area = length * width

# Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

# Display the area and perimeter on the screen
print("Area:", area)
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
```

This code defines the length and width of the rectangle using variables. It then calculates the area by multiplying the length and width, and the perimeter by adding the length and width together and multiplying by 2. Finally, it displays the calculated area and perimeter on the screen using the `print` function.
