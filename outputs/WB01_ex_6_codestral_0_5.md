 Thought: Given the constraints of not using functions and only using specific variable names (x, y, z), I'll write a Python program that calculates the mean, sum total, and product total of three initialized real numbers as per user requirements.

   Code:
   ```py
   x = 5.0  # initializing first real number
   y = 10.0  # initializing second real number
   z = 15.0  # initializing third real number

   # Calculate Mean
   mean_value = (x + y + z) / 3
   print("Mean:", mean_value)

   # Calculate Sum Total
   sum_total = x + y + z
   print("Sum Total:", sum_total)

   # Calculate Product Total
   product_total = x * y * z
   print("Product Total:", product_total)
   ```
