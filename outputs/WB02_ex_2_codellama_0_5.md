To solve this problem, we can create a function called `calculate_oer` that takes two arguments: `annual_nominal_rate` and `number_of_periods`. The function will use these values to calculate the OER according to the formula provided.

Here is an example of how you could implement this function in Python:
```
def calculate_oer(annual_nominal_rate, number_of_periods):
    return (1 + annual_nominal_rate / number_of_periods) ** number_of_periods - 1
```
You can then call this function with the appropriate values to get the OER for a given TNA and number of periods. For example:
```
oer = calculate_oer(0.08, 12)
print(oer) # Output: 0.0769
```
Note that this implementation assumes that the annual nominal rate is passed as a decimal value (i.e., 0.08 for an 8% ANN). If the rate is passed as a percentage (i.e., 8%), you would need to convert it to a decimal value before using it in the calculation.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
