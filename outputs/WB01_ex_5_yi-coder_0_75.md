Here is an example Python code snippet that meets your requirements:

```python
# defining the lengths of the rectangle's sides as variables
length = 5
width = 3

# calculating the area and perimeter
area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

# printing the results on the screen
print("Area: ", area)
print("Perimeter: ", perimeter)
```
In this program, we first define the variables `length` and `width` to represent the sides' lengths of our rectangle. Then, based on the formulas for calculating an area and a perimeter of a rectangle, we calculate these values. Finally, we print out the results using Python's built-in `print()` function.

If you cannot use functions or any other Python element as mentioned in your problem statement, this might be the simplest way to solve it in accordance with provided constraints.
