# Calculate the net salary for a salesperson based on their sales and commission rate

# Basic salary per month: 2000 euros
basic_salary = 2000

# Commission rate: 3%
commission_rate = 0.03

# Income tax rate: 32%
income_tax_rate = 0.32

# Input the total sales made by the salesperson during the last month
total_sales = float(input("Please enter the total sales made by the salesperson during the last month: "))

# Calculate the commission for the salesperson
commission = total_sales * commission_rate

# Calculate the total amount to be paid to the salesperson, including commission and income tax
total_amount = basic_salary + commission - (income_tax_rate * commission)

# Print the net salary for the salesperson
print("The net salary for the salesperson is:", round(total_amount))

This code uses variables to store the different values and calculations, rather than using input() to read data from the keyboard. It also uses round() function to round the result to the nearest integer.
