The problem statement is clear: given a time expressed in hours, minutes, and seconds, display the total seconds elapsed since the last midnight and the seconds remaining until the next midnight. To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of seconds since the last midnight, which is equal to the number of hours multiplied by 3600, plus the number of minutes multiplied by 60, plus the number of seconds. Then, we can subtract this value from the total number of seconds in a day (86400) to get the number of seconds remaining until the next midnight.

Here is an example code that solves this problem:
```python
# Get the input time in hours, minutes, and seconds
hours = int(input("Enter the number of hours: "))
minutes = int(input("Enter the number of minutes: "))
seconds = int(input("Enter the number of seconds: "))

# Calculate the total number of seconds since the last midnight
total_seconds = (hours * 3600) + (minutes * 60) + seconds

# Subtract this value from the total number of seconds in a day to get the number of seconds remaining until the next midnight
remaining_seconds = 86400 - total_seconds

# Display the results
print("Total seconds since last midnight:", total_seconds)
print("Seconds remaining until next midnight:", remaining_seconds)
```
This code uses variables to store the input time in hours, minutes, and seconds, and then calculates the total number of seconds since the last midnight using the provided formula. Finally, it subtracts this value from the total number of seconds in a day to get the number of seconds remaining until the next midnight, and displays the results to the user.
