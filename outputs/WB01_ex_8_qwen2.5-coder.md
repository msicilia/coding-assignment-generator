Sure! Below is the Python code to solve the problem as per your requirements:

```python
# Define the basic salary
basic_salary = 2000

# Define the commission rate
commission_rate = 0.03

# Define the income tax rate
income_tax_rate = 0.32

# Define the sales amount (using a variable for exercise)
sales_amount = 50000  # You can change this value to test different sales amounts

# Calculate the total salary including commission
total_salary_with_commission = basic_salary + (sales_amount * commission_rate)

# Calculate the net salary after income tax deduction
net_salary = total_salary_with_commission - (total_salary_with_commission * income_tax_rate)

# Print the net salary
print("The net salary of the salesperson is:", net_salary)
```

This code calculates the net salary based on the given basic salary, commission rate, and income tax rate. You can change the `sales_amount` variable to test different scenarios.

Here are a few example test cases:

1. If `sales_amount = 50000`, the output will be:
   ```
   The net salary of the salesperson is: 2380.0
   ```

2. If `sales_amount = 100000`, the output will be:
   ```
   The net salary of the salesperson is: 4760.0
   ```

3. If `sales_amount = 25000`, the output will be:
   ```
   The net salary of the salesperson is: 1895.0
   ```

You can run this code in a Python environment to see the results for different sales amounts.
