To solve this problem without using any Python functions, we can use variables to simulate the behavior of the code.

First, let's define the basic salary of a salesperson as 2000 euros per month:
```
basic_salary = 2000
```
Next, we need to calculate the commission for the total sales made by the salesperson during the last month. We can do this by multiplying the total sales by 3%:
```
commission = total_sales * 0.03
```
Now, let's subtract the income tax from the total obtained:
```
net_salary = total_sales - income_tax
```
Finally, we can print the net salary on the screen using the `print()` function:
```
print(f"Net salary: {net_salary}")
```
Here's the complete code:
```
basic_salary = 2000
total_sales = 1000
commission = total_sales * 0.03
income_tax = commission * 0.32
net_salary = total_sales - income_tax
print(f"Net salary: {net_salary}")
```
This code calculates the net salary of a salesperson based on the amount of sales made during the last month, without using any Python functions.
