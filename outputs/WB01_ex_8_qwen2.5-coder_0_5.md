Thoughts: The task requires calculating the net salary of a salesperson given their total sales. We need to include constants for the basic salary and commission rate, calculate the commission based on the total sales, apply the income tax deduction, and then output the net salary.

Code:
```py
# Constants
BASIC_SALARY = 2000
COMMISSION_RATE = 0.03
INCOME_TAX_RATE = 0.32

# Example total sales amount (this should be replaced with the actual total sales variable)
total_sales = 50000

# Calculate commission
commission = total_sales * COMMISSION_RATE

# Calculate pre-tax salary
pre_tax_salary = BASIC_SALARY + commission

# Calculate income tax
income_tax = pre_tax_salary * INCOME_TAX_RATE

# Calculate net salary
net_salary = pre_tax_salary - income_tax

# Print the net salary
print("Net Salary:", net_salary)
```

Example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:** Total Sales = 0 euros
   - Expected Output: Net Salary: 2000.0

2. **Test Case 2:** Total Sales = 100,000 euros
   - Expected Output: Net Salary: 5764.0

3. **Test Case 3:** Total Sales = 500,000 euros
   - Expected Output: Net Salary: 29428.0

4. **Test Case 4:** Total Sales = 1,000,000 euros
   - Expected Output: Net Salary: 36796.0
