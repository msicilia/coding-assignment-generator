The provided code is able to calculate the product of two numbers entered by the user using recursion. However, there are a few improvements that can be made to make it more robust and easier to understand. Here's a revised version of the code with some suggestions for improvement:
```
def multiply(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return a + multiply(a, b - 1)

# Add a function to handle invalid input
def validate_input(a, b):
    if not isinstance(a, int) or not isinstance(b, int):
        raise ValueError("Input must be integers")
    elif a < 0 or b < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input cannot be negative")

# Add a main function to call the multiply function and handle input
def main():
    try:
        # Get input from user
        a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
        b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

        # Validate input
        validate_input(a, b)

        # Calculate product using multiply function
        result = multiply(a, b)

        # Print result
        print(f"The product of {a} and {b} is {result}.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter integers only.")
```
Suggestions for improvement:

1. Use a main function to handle the input and output of the program, making it more modular and easier to understand.
2. Add a function to validate the input, checking if it's an integer and raising an error if it's not. This helps prevent invalid input from being passed to the multiply function.
3. Use a try-except block to handle any errors that may occur during input or output, making it more robust.
4. Add comments to explain what each part of the code does, making it easier for others to understand and maintain.
5. Use f-strings to print the result, which makes the code more readable.
6. Consider using a function like `raw_input()` or `gets()` instead of `input()` to get user input, as this is considered less secure than other methods of getting user input.
