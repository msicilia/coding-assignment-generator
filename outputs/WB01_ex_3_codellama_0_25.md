  You are correct. The previous response was not helpful. I apologize for any confusion caused. Here is a more accurate answer to your question:

You can write Python code that takes in time expressed in hours, minutes, and seconds as input, and displays the total seconds elapsed since the last midnight and the seconds remaining until the next midnight.

Here's an example of how you could do this:
```
# Take in the time as input in hours, minutes, and seconds
hours = float(input("Enter the number of hours: "))
minutes = float(input("Enter the number of minutes: "))
seconds = float(input("Enter the number of seconds: "))

# Calculate the total number of seconds elapsed since midnight
total_seconds = (hours * 60 + minutes) * 60 + seconds

# Print the total number of seconds elapsed since midnight
print("Total seconds since midnight:", total_seconds)

# Calculate the number of seconds remaining until the next midnight
remaining_seconds = (24 - hours) * 3600 + (59 - minutes) * 60 + (59 - seconds)

# Print the number of seconds remaining until the next midnight
print("Seconds remaining until next midnight:", remaining_seconds)
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
