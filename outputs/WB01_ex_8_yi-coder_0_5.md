Here's an example Python code to solve this problem:

```python
# Variables given in the problem
sales = 10000  # Total sales made by the salesperson during the last month
tax_rate = 32/100   # Tax rate as a decimal fraction (i.e., 32% is 32/100)
commission_rate = 3/100  # Commission rate as a decimal fraction (i.e., 3% is 3/100)
basic_salary = 2000    # Basic salary of the salesperson in euros per month

# Calculations based on given variables
total_earnings = basic_salary + (sales * commission_rate)  # Total earnings including the basic salary and the commission from sales
net_salary = total_earnings - (total_earnings * tax_rate)   # Net salary after deducting income tax 

# Print out final result
print("The net salary is: ", net_salary)
```
In this code, we're calculating the total earnings by adding the basic salary and the commission from sales. Then, we're finding the net salary by subtracting the income tax rate from the total earnings. We then print out the net salary.
