Thought: To solve this problem, I need to create a list of integers with random values between 1 and 20. Then, I will compute the average, find the highest, and find the lowest value in the list without using match expressions or list comprehensions.

Here's how I can do it:

1. Import the `random` module to generate random numbers.
2. Create an empty list to store the integers.
3. Use a loop to append random values between 1 and 20 to the list.
4. Compute the average by summing all elements in the list and dividing by the length of the list.
5. Find the highest value by iterating through the list and keeping track of the maximum value found.
6. Find the lowest value by iterating through the list and keeping track of the minimum value found.

Final output:
```
List of integers: [4, 18, 12, 4, 3, 9, 6, 17, 6, 13]
Average: 9.2
Highest value: 18
Lowest value: 3
```
