 The Python code provided above does exactly what is required. It creates two separate lists: one for even numbers and another for odd numbers. As it iterates through the original list of integers, each number is checked to determine if it's even or odd. If a number is even, it's inserted into the 'even_numbers' list at its appropriate sorted position using a while loop. Conversely, if the number is odd, it's inserted into the 'odd_numbers' list in its corresponding sorted position. This results in two lists: one with all even numbers from the original list sorted in ascending order, and another with all odd numbers sorted in descending order.
