 The solution was provided earlier in this conversation. Here's a summary:

   I defined two Python functions to convert units between square meters (m²) and Barns. The function `m2_to_barn` converts an area from square meters to Barns, while the function `barn_to_m2` does the reverse.

   These functions were implemented according to the conversion formula provided in the problem statement: 1 Barn = 10^-28 m². This formula was used directly in the implementation of the functions.

   To ensure modularity and information hiding, I defined these two functions separately. This allows each function to have a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

   The solution follows best practices for function definition and usage. There are no data structures used other than basic data types (float), and there are no loops or conditional statements.

   Here's the Python code that solves the problem:

```python
def m2_to_barn(m2):
    return m2 * 1e-28

def barn_to_m2(barn):
    return barn / 1e-28
```

I then tested these functions with a few test cases to ensure they are working correctly:

```python
print(m2_to_barn(1)) # Expected output: 1e-28
print(barn_to_m2(1)) # Expected output: 1e+28
```
