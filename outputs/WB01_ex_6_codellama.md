You are correct, I apologize for my mistake earlier. The `sum` variable is already defined as a tool, and trying to assign a new value to it would erase the existing tool. To fix this issue, we need to give the new variable a different name, such as `sum1`. Here's an updated version of the code that should work:
```
x = 3
y = 5
z = 7

mean = (x + y + z) / 3
print("Mean:", mean)

sum1 = x + y + z
print("Sum:", sum1)

product = x * y * z
print("Product:", product)
```
This code should now run without any errors. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
