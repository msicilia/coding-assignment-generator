The instructor provides a prompt for writing Python code to perform the cost calculation for a truck on a trip. The student is asked to use variables instead of input() to exercise the code, and they are not allowed to use functions.

Here's an example test case that takes into account the additional requirements:
```py
distance = 500
diesel_used = 20
cost_per_liter = 2.5
other_costs = 100
total_cost = diesel_used * cost_per_liter + other_costs
kilometers_per_liter = distance / diesel_used
total_cost_per_kilometer = total_cost / distance
print(f"Total cost of the trip: {total_cost}")
print(f"Kilometers per liter: {kilometers_per_liter}")
print(f"Total cost per kilometer (including maintenance costs): {total_cost_per_kilometer}")
```
The student is expected to write code that performs the cost calculation for a truck on a trip, using variables instead of input() and without using functions. The test case includes example values for the variables, which the student can use to exercise their code.
